# 1. Have you ever withdrawn from, been dismissed, suspended, disciplined
by (formally or informally), or placed on probation from an academic
institution (for academic or non-academic reasons)? Do you know of any
pending or unresolved disciplinary matters at an academic institution?
Do you have any reason to believe an academic institution will be
initiating an investigation or disciplinary charge against you in the
future? If yes, provide a detailed explanation here.

**100 words**

# Draft 2

I have only withdrawn from an academic institution on a medical leave of absence; I have not been dismissed, suspended, disciplined, or placed on probation. I am not aware of any pending or potential disciplinary matters or investigations. In Fall 2020, three weeks into the third semester of my undergraduate career, an existing health complication combined with the coronavirus pandemic compelled me to take a medical leave of absence unrelated to academic performance. I was hospitalized, entered long-term treatment, and returned in Fall 2021. Since then, I maintained a perfect GPA, completed treatment, discontinued all medication, and sustained recovery.

# Draft 1

I have only withdrawn from an academic institution; I have not been dismissed, suspended, disciplined, or placed on probation. I am not aware of any pending or potential disciplinary matters or investigations. I have a documented history of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features and a co-occurring Substance Use Disorder, which disrupted my first year at Vanderbilt. In Fall 2020, three weeks into the semester, I experienced a psychotic break unrelated to academics and withdrew. I was hospitalized, entered residential treatment, and returned in Fall 2021. Since then, I maintained 4.0 GPA, completed treatment, discontinued medication, and sustained abstinence-based recovery.
