If you wish to clarify any information you provided in the application, please do so in this section. For example, if you took a leave of absence, faced unusual circumstances in your studies or in your career, you may explain that here. You may also include anything that you feel are important for the Admissions Committee to know. This can include disruptions to your education and/or access to leadership involvement.

As mentioned previously, a medical leave of absence prompted my one-year withdrawal from university. A longstanding health condition combined with the coronavirus pandemic disrupted my first year at university to the point of seeking medical attention mere weeks after beginning the second. That time solely allowed intensive professional care and complicated my undergraduate education, including leadership opportunities. Despite the discontinuity, I graduated with a perfect major GPA with honors, was chosen for numerous leadership positions, and spoke to the entire freshman class regarding my experience. I donate to my university to help similar students.
