# Draft 2

My friend could not even remember his great-grandfather's name. As clouds of Tennessee pipe tobacco filled the room, he described wandering through rows of identical headstones, searching for a grave that might as well have been anonymous. This was not mere forgetfulness; it was the inevitable outcome of a culture that isolates death and the elderly. Our shared visits to Buddhist monasteries had taught us to contemplate impermanence, yet here we witnessed how modern contexts make such reflection nearly impossible.

As a leader, I comprehend that meaningful change stems from personal initiative. Recognizing this cultural gap around death and memory, we started ideating pragmatic solutions with philosophical implications. Scrawled post-it notes lined the walls but at first nothing seemed to stick. Given my friend's experience, we settled on an individual-level solution: a gravestone-attachable near-field communication tag to preserve one's informational legacy. While my friend seemed pleased, we nonetheless needed customer exposure to assess market fit. Fortunately, my small prototype enabled our successful application to the National Science Foundation Regional Innovation Corps for intensive entrepreneurial training and customer discovery interviews. 

The feedback was tough. Conversations with elderly individuals revealed implicit thanatophobia, as few people even mentioned their own death and legacy instead of others. Selling directly to individuals seemed foolish in retrospect. Meanwhile, mortuary professionals described reluctance to manage physical products even with commercial upsides. They already struggled to navigate engagement and practices like cremation. The societal implications ultimately lagged behind questions of profit. As an idealistic leader, I needed to meter my philosophical leanings or risk alienating those I serve. Whether listening to unspoken fears of the elderly or operational constraints of mortuary professionals, I learned to prioritize understanding over imposing solutions.

The criticism therefore did not deter but impel our curiosity. I began to develop a software solution from scratch geared towards organizations that leveraged geospatial technology and artificial intelligence to digitize entire burial sites. Refining the product unlocked partnership opportunities. Even with functioning software, the challenge remained to communicate the value to an aging, tech-averse crowd. Remembering the customer discovery interviews, we curtailed technical language and focused on business-level pain points. An outdoor tools company eventually licensed our software to build an industry-specific product for holding flags and wreaths. We later secured several pilot projects with cemeteries themselves including the locally prestigious Nashville City Cemetery. 

These wins were refreshing even at a distance. I had been working in Mexico as a Fulbright Scholar while actively developing our software on the side. Though separation may seem to spell disaster for founders, my experiences proved invaluable in molding the business. I discovered ample opportunities like taking innovation classes, interviewing founders for work, or bringing my startup to my university's entrepreneurship hub. However, the most significant breakthroughs involved first-hand cultural exposure to Mexican traditions. Day of the Dead mobilized the whole country to reconnect with late loved ones in cemeteries lined with marigolds, tissue paper, and sweet bread. I value cross-cultural exchange as a leader for a reason; witnessing the Mexican emphasis on collective memory transformed our value proposition from individual to community legacies. As innovation evidently existed beyond the U.S., so too did this ancestral connection exist beyond Mexico. It just needed cultural adaptation to flourish. These experiences beyond my professional specialization proved vital to the company and our spirit. That realization revitalized our courage to present at a funeral industry trade show where dozens of companies expressed purchase intentions. 

With the first customers on the horizon and multiple investment offers, we incorporated under the name Kapala. The etymology symbolizes impermanence and occurs within both the Proto-Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan language branches. Like the word, I too strive to straddle distinct cultural contexts as a change-maker. Though funerary practices are ubiquitous, Mexico and China are perhaps the strongest exemplars of ancestor devotion and dedicated holidays for cemetery visits. The former already shaped my trajectory, while the latter is the ideal next destination. Tomb-Sweeping Day and the Double Ninth Festival epitomize the ancestral connection Kapala seeks to kindle, while Buddhist culture that inspired the ethos pervades from the three teachings. Moreover, the coexistence of tradition and technology is unparalleled; I must connect with those who embody this nexus to realize my niche as a leader. Such inroads offered only by Schwarzman would both expand and compound my existing momentum. The journey thus far has tailored my leadership approach toward initiative, perseverance, and adaptation across cultures. With Schwarzman sculpting my progression, I will ensure collective memory endures rather than vanishing like smoke. 
# Draft 1

The smell of Tennessee tobacco filled the room as my friend puffed his pipe recounting a recent visit to the local cemetery to visit his great grandfather's grave. Finding the headstone was impossible, let alone any additional information. His description harkened to an observation by social anthropologist Biao Xiang. Namely, contemporary preoccupations concern the very near and the very far while disregarding "the nearby." Correspondingly, self and world take precedent in neglect of the community. While re-focusing on existing quotidian interactions is possible, what about those that have passed? Indeed, my friend's inability to recall even his great grandfather's name represented a terrifying commonality within the United States. Oral tradition only extends so far, especially within such an individualist culture that atomizes death and the elderly. From our monastery visits as Mahayana Buddhists, we also recognized the value yet difficulty of contemplating impermanence within occidental contexts. 

After empathizing and defining the problem, we ideated pragmatic solutions with philosophical implications. Scrawled post-it notes lined the walls but at first nothing seemed to stick. Given my friend's personal experience, we settled on an individual-level solution: a gravestone-attachable near-field communication tag to preserve one's informational legacy.

The Chinese super-app and mini-program ecosystem would be a first-hand lesson on app design. Leadership training, global peers, and immersion in China would complement these drives. Regardless, the ongoing evolution of the startup means that existing growth continues to compound. My commitment is measurable: cemeteries mapped, records validated, families reconnected, caretakers paid. I will keep honoring the nearby so remembrance outlasts convenience and collective wisdom endures rather than vanishing like smoke.
