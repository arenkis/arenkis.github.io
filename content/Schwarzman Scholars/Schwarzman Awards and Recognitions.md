*Fulbright Mexico Binational Business Fellowship*

I was chosen for the Fulbright Mexico Binational Business Fellowship, combining graduate study with an applied role at Endeavor. I led cross-functional research to produce reports for Oracle, American Express, and the World Bank, utilizing internal software and statistics to manage large-scale data. I delivered the findings to senior leadership and major media outlets. Self-initiated opportunities like consulting for the Mexican government punctuated my work.

*National Science Foundation I-Corps*

My technological idea was selected by my university's entrepreneurship hub for intensive entrepreneurial training. I conducted 50+ interviews during the customer discovery process, pivoting the value proposition to focus on businesses after discovering people's reluctance to consider their own legacies. I utilized those insights to continue developing production-ready software currently being sold today.

*Departmental Honors*

Selected to the departmental honors program on the basis of a 4.0 major GPA, I led two original studies on intercultural addiction recovery under Dr. Jordan Jurinsky, who emphasized the significance of research with lived experience. I designed hypotheses, navigated IRB approval, supervised data collection, and completed mixed method analysis. I presented findings to the board, a peer-reviewed journal, and a university symposium to inform policies and best practices.

*Foreign Language Area Studies Fellowships*

I was awarded the summer fellowship for intensive Portuguese study in Brazil because of a 4.0 major GPA. My placement involved graduate-level courses in SÃ£o Paulo in the most advanced cohort, producing addiction research in Brazil. My success resulted in my being awarded the yearlong fellowship, typically reserved for graduate students. I leveraged that extension with advanced study and an independent research project under Dr. Benjamin Legg on the heteronyms of Fernando Pessoa.

*U.S. Utility Patent*

## Draft 2

What began as a third-grade idea to help elderly golfers avoid bending over evolved into my first utility patent at seventeen. I independently navigated complex U.S. Patent and Trademark Office requirements, learning to translate creative solutions into defensible intellectual property. This early exposure to patent law proved invaluable when establishing intellectual property strategy for my startup. The experience taught me that innovation requires both creative problem-solving and the persistence to formalize legally protectable ideas.

## Draft 1

As a third-grade aspiring golfer, I felt saddened at the difficulty elderly people may have experienced when bending over to tee a golf ball. Throughout my adolescence, I developed a solution to deliver a golf ball to the green from below automatically. The complexities of intellectual property law racked my brain, and I had to revise my request to meet standards. I was nonetheless awarded a patent that has informed intellectual property decisions at Kapala.
