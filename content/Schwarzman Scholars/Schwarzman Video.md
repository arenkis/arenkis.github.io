I'm sitting in Nashville City Cemetery, home to over 21,000 graves dating back to the early 1700s. Behind me lie the stories of generations, yet it only takes three to lose a piece of oral family history. Most American families, including my own, struggle to remember even our great-grandparents' names.

This disconnect with our heritage inspired my startup journey. When my friend couldn't find his great-grandfather's grave, we recognized a crisis of memory in cultures that isolate death from daily life.

My path led through Buddhist monasteries emphasizing the contemplation of impermanence, then to Mexico as a Fulbright Scholar, where Day of the Dead showed me how entire cultures can honor ancestry. These experiences shaped Kapala, my cemetery digitization startup that's now partnering with historic sites like this one.

China has arguably the world's strongest tradition of venerating the dead, where Tomb-Sweeping Day brings millions to grave sites, yet technology and tradition seamlessly merge. With Schwarzman, I will immerse myself within this unique combination while gaining the leadership development necessary to scale globally inspired innovation.

My vision is to bridge these cultural approaches by creating technology that helps families reconnect with their heritage, ensuring that collective wisdom endures.

I am sitting in the historic Nashville City Cemetery, home to over 21,000 graves extending back to the early 1700s. A nonprofit organization preserves the memories here, unlike my experience in Mexico where Day of the Dead draws family members to memorials. This level of organization displayed here is rare among U.S. cemeteries; family businesses dominate

Yet, such commitment among U.S. cemeteries is rare; the majority lack

The cemetery holds a substantial record of regional history, with over 21,500 individuals interred. Among them are at least 140 veterans, amounting to just over half of one percent of the population, and 32 individuals designated as famous, making up about one-tenth of one percent. This indicates that while the grounds reflect some nationally recognized figures, their presence represents only a small fraction of the whole. Generationally, the cemetery’s earliest recorded burials trace back to people born in the 1720s, while more recent generations extend into births from the 2020s. Death records span from 1790 to 2025, with the earliest loss represented by Ann Maclin Cross in 1790 and the most recent by Minerva C. Hays in 2025. The largest waves of interments correspond to deaths in the mid-19th century, particularly the 1850s and 1860s, when together more than 14,700 burials occurred. Age analysis suggests life was often short: among a significant sample of more than 6,400 individuals, the average age at death is only about 31 years, with a median age of 27. This indicates many deaths occurred in childhood or early adulthood, even as some individuals certainly lived longer lives. The records also reveal strong ties to Tennessee, and especially Nashville and Davidson County. The most common birthplaces listed include “Tennessee, USA,” Nashville, and Davidson County itself, with smaller but notable contributions from Virginia. Likewise, the most frequent death locations are Nashville (over 1,600 instances), Davidson County, and Tennessee more broadly, reflecting the local nature of the cemetery’s role. A smaller number of burials are connected to other cities such as New Orleans. In sum, the cemetery preserves more than two centuries of community history. Its population highlights deep ties to central Tennessee, the presence of public figures and veterans amid a much larger local citizenry, and demographic patterns that speak to both the hardships and endurance of earlier generations.

I am sitting in the meditation hall at my local Buddhist temple. Though you would never guess, it resides in my hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. People are always suprised when they discover I practice given my southern roots, though I have introduced newcomers and heritage Buddhists alike to this space. 

The only thing Buddhist in my childhood was this jade Budai statue, supposedly from China. A Chan Buddhist master drew me to the tradition, after I found Western philosophy unsatisfying for my existential unrest. I later spent my college summers volunteering at a monastery that presented the bodhisattva ideal of boundless compassion for all beings.

Even putting aside the metaphysics, I was so moved of such profound altruism. It has become my north star throughout my diverse pursuits, most recently building software to encourage meditation on impermanence. Akin to this small but mighty temple, these aspirations take inspiration from those grander in scale. Despite the seeming impossibility, like the bodhisattva tasked with helping uncountable beings, I do not give up. I think back to that curious southern boy who saw the lines even if he couldn't connect the dots.
