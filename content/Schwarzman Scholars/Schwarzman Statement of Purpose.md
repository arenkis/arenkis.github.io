# Draft 3

Of all the myriad locations across Mexico City, my friends from the National Autonomous University of Mexico were most eager to show me Chinatown and the Chapultepec Zoo's Xin Xin, the only giant panda not on loan from China. "If you can speak Chinese, you can write your own salary," remarked Alejandro, alluding to the abundant binational economics and glaring knowledge gap. The conversation continued into their preferred study abroad destinations, not in the United States or Europe but Asia. The Beijing Education Commission began a partnership with their university months later. These trends became increasingly evident at my job researching entrepreneurship within emerging markets. "Unicorns," technology startups valued over one billion, no longer concentrated solely within the United States but the world with China as the runner-up. Amidst such personal revelations, it was hardly surprising that my coworker was applying to the Schwarzman Scholars inspired by a previous colleague. Her description had me hooked. 

I was attracted to China in high school from policy debate and Mahayana Buddhism, but my college studies pulled me towards South America. Similar to Mexico, my immersion across the continent illuminated the false dichotomy with exposure to BRICS in Brazil and the Belt and Road in Peru. Indeed, bridging Latin American and Chinese business ecosystems carried enormous potential. Mexico seemed hospitable to startups yet dependent upon increasingly absent U.S. infrastructure. China appeared opportune but poorly understood by outsiders. Realizing this global potential would thus necessitate multilateral leadership.

I intend to rekindle cultural engagement with death by bridging practices from exemplars. Living in Buddhist monastic environments inspired that core philosophy, and Mexico's Day of The Dead transformed those ideas into a startup. However, the only culture as emphatic of Mahayana Buddhism and ancestor worship is China. The only program as tailored to innovation leadership is Schwarzman. 

Like Mexico City, Beijing is the startup epicenter of its country. The Zhongguancun technology hub houses giants like ByteDance and Tsinghua University. Enrolling in the latter would grant privileged positioning at the heart of China's entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially for a founder like myself. Courses like the Entrepreneurial Strategy Modules would help navigate complex startup landscape, building upon my undergraduate innovation studies. The X-Lab at Tsinghua would provide insights to my growing startup, much like at EPIC Lab did at the Autonomous Technological University of Mexico. The like-minded company of founders would always be nearby at TusPark. 

Through Schwarzman's Deep Dive fieldwork, I would immerse myself in China's evolving relationship with mortality. Mandarin language skills would enable ethnographic research during Tomb-Sweeping Festival on traditional ancestor veneration. This cultural foundation would inform my capstone on China's rapidly aging society and pressure on urban cemetery infrastructure. I would convert these insights to solutions through mentorship from leaders who have successfully incorporated Chinese insights into Western technology. An internship at Monterrey Technology Institute's Innovation Hub Tec-China would to bridge Mexican and Chinese entrepreneurial insights. I would collaborate with Tsinghua's Department of Computer Science to port my software into a WeChat Mini Program for Beijing cemetery pilots. This synthesis would establish the foundation to address modern mortality, beginning where the need is most acute: China's megacities.

Like Mexico City, Beijing is the startup epicenter of its country. The Zhongguancun technology hub houses giants like Lenovo, ByteDance, and of course Tsinghua University. Enrolling in the latter would grant privileged positioning at the heart of China's entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially for a founder like myself. Courses like the Entrepreneurial Strategy Modules would help navigate complex startup landscape, building upon my undergraduate innovation studies. The X-Lab at Tsinghua would provide insights to my growing startup, much like at EPIC Lab did at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. The likeminded company of founders would always be nearby at TusPark. With the Schwarzman Scholars program, I would also pursue an optional internship like Tecnológico de Monterrey's Innovation Hub Tec-China to build upon my background.

Growing a company through trilateral input would unlock unprecedented understanding of the ecosystems to link. I would first incorporate such knowledge domestically before returning abroad as a conduit. Whether persisting as founder or transitioning to facilitator, staying in startups would beget moving to San Francisco as the ideal transnational juncture. The latter would springboard into roles assisting software startups with internationalization, as U.S. culture and language still predicate international business. I would leverage networks within Mexico City and Beijing to create corridors amongst institutions filling the aforementioned gaps; these pathways would invariably bridge capital markets, paving the way for venture capital opportunities. As China, Mexico, and the United States continue to occupy top trade positions with one another, the Schwarzman Scholars would catalyze my ability to connect innovation ecosystems.

# Draft 1

Dr. Xiang's theory echoed my pandemic experience; I became isolated and paranoid in a concurrent struggle with addiction, an intergenerational malady inherited from my Latvian grandparents yet unknown to my teenage self. I danced with death but remained ignorant until faced with hospitalization. Besides biological and psychological interventions, the ultimate treatment was reconstructing the everyday---people, places, and things. Joining a recovery community checked all the boxes and eventually facilitated related leadership roles as a crisis counselor, researcher, and board member. Recovery nonetheless comprises not only the material but the spiritual. 

Though my childhood home contained nothing more than a jade Budai statue, I was drawn to Mahayana Buddhism as an adolescent through the works of Chan master Thich Nhat Hanh. The bodhisattva ideal of compassion for all beings deeply resonated and helped during hospitalization. That healing ultimately empowered me to spend college summers volunteering at a monastery,

Recovery and Buddhism accustomed me to the nearby and impermanence, which represent the focal point of my current trajectory. My foundation in the startup ecosystem fostered my own 

Rooting innovation within tradition is essential 

philosophical foundation for my external pursuits

Developing the software in Mexico, 

Ask Tennesseans what makes their state so great, and you get answers like country music, hot chicken, or southern hospitality. My go-to answer is the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse first established to research nuclear energy. Sensitivity now metered my pride as I presented the benefits of molten salt reactors in Japan, a country devastated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdown just years prior. As one of two delegates representing the United States to a global audience, my conduct reflected my country. What about meltdowns? Weaponization? Historical baggage? asked representatives from China, India, Singapore, and more. It was rewarding to champion safer advancements but more so to contextualize my perspective. Besides sustainable innovation, the symposium catalyzed my intrigue for vegetarianism, Buddhism, and Asia more broadly. The former two contrasted with my bible-belt barbecue upbringing, though a panel on animal products and a monk on alms round impressed me deeply.
