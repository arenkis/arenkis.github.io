	- Why China?
	- Why Schwarzman?
	- Why you?
	- Write what you have to say, be yourself, ensure it is authentic to you
- Dan Lawes (UK)
	- Reflect on where you have come from and where you want to go
	- Do it as a reflection exercise for you anyway so the process is useful
- Beauclaire Mbanya

	- Every Schwarzman scholar is unique; you will find differences
