This section is an opportunity to showcase up to five leadership roles
that illustrate your demonstrated leadership experience. For each entry,
include a concise explanation of why the role is significant to your leadership profile, as well as your distinct contribution, outcome, or initiative. These activities will be displayed in order by the most recent start date.

**75 words per entry**

Kapala
*Technical Founder*

My co-founder and I bonded one evening about the paucity of information at burial sites. We prototyped a gravestone-attachable chip and conducted customer interviews that directed us to visitor-facing cemetery digitization. Though I built computers and software growing up, creating the full stack from scratch proved monumental. The software ultimately enabled pilot projects and tradeshow participations

 that attracted initial customers. I currently lead product development while wearing many hats.

Lodestone Ventures
*Venture Capital Analyst*

I was selected among peers for the one open spot, seeking experience with international capital markets. Assessing business models, sourcing deals at tech conferences, and meeting founders were all exhilarating tasks. Yet, internal processes for handling the deal flow demonstrated an organizational need. I utilized human-centered design to develop investor-approved proprietary backend software for managing startup prospects. I was voted to receive the Impact Award for my cohort, with the software still in use today.

Association of Recovery in Higher Education
*Board Member*

I was elected to the board, aflame at the start of my tenure. The prior CEO had been fired amidst internal controversy. While serving on the governance and finance committees, I helped rewrite institutional policy to define better boundaries for the future leader. The process did not mitigate my original contributions. I setup channels to incorporate student voices into the decision-making process and co-founded the still enduring research committee to integrate the latest recovery research.

Accelerator
*Lead Consultant*

I entered Accelerator as a consultant to find my niche within a business career. I was elected to lead consulting for a Fortune 500, though working with a startup and prototyping an app for an innovation-oriented multinational corporation kindled my present passion for innovation. Senior leadership selected our team for excellence in research. I was awarded team MVP twice and the highest 360 feedback scores of all consultants that summer.

Nada-Winchester International Symposium
*Delegate for the United States*

I was chosen from my entire class as one of two United States representatives at a global symposium in Japan for select young leaders across a dozen countries. My delegation exchanged monthly essays with our international peers and delivered a presentation on nuclear energy at the Tennessee Oak Ridge laboratory. All nations present collectively produced a proposal addressing society and the natural world. A convincing talk even kickstarted my conversion to vegetarianism.

Vanderbilt Recovery Support
*Member / Speaker*

Selected as Vanderbiltâ€™s Recovery Ambassador, I delivered campus talks to incoming freshmen, residence halls, and local high schools on addiction, mental health, and help seeking. I partnered with Student Affairs and Counseling to design programming, trained peer facilitators, and created resource guides requested by faculty. My outreach reached thousands of students and parents across multiple events each semester.

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
*Crisis Counselor*

I guided hundreds of visitors in crisis to safety through voice and text conversation. Lived experience within the mental health system enabled me to empathize and understand the resources available. I collaborated with new volunteers, organized follow-ups, and coordinated intervention when necessary. 

Vanderbilt Student Government
*Senator*

I was elected on a platform of protecting a decades-old language immersion dormitory that Vanderbilt ultimately cancelled. I learned a lesson in idealism when institutional policy trumped student initiatives in terms of the protection sought, though I still passed  initiatives with my fellow area representative like improving opportunities for dining workers. I hosted town halls with my area's student body to ensure I represented their voice on other important matters.

Endeavor
*Insights Project Lead*

Repeat of previous?

Pabmasambhava Buddhist Center
*Learning Dharma Skills Volunteer*
