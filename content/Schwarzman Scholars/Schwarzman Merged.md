*Fulbright Mexico Binational Business Fellowship*

I was chosen for the Fulbright Mexico Binational Business Fellowship, combining graduate study with an applied role at Endeavor. I led cross-functional research to produce reports for Oracle, American Express, and the World Bank, utilizing internal software and statistics to manage large-scale data. I delivered the findings to senior leadership and major media outlets. Self-initiated opportunities like consulting for the Mexican government punctuated my work.

*National Science Foundation I-Corps*

My technological idea was selected by my university's entrepreneurship hub for intensive entrepreneurial training. I conducted 50+ interviews during the customer discovery process, pivoting the value proposition to focus on businesses after discovering people's reluctance to consider their own legacies. I utilized those insights to continue developing production-ready software currently being sold today.

*Departmental Honors*

Selected to the departmental honors program on the basis of a 4.0 major GPA, I led two original studies on intercultural addiction recovery under Dr. Jordan Jurinsky, who emphasized the significance of research with lived experience. I designed hypotheses, navigated IRB approval, supervised data collection, and completed mixed method analysis. I presented findings to the board, a peer-reviewed journal, and a university symposium to inform policies and best practices.

*Foreign Language Area Studies Fellowships*

I was awarded the summer fellowship for intensive Portuguese study in Brazil because of a 4.0 major GPA. My placement involved graduate-level courses in São Paulo in the most advanced cohort, producing addiction research in Brazil. My success resulted in my being awarded the yearlong fellowship, typically reserved for graduate students. I leveraged that extension with advanced study and an independent research project under Dr. Benjamin Legg on the heteronyms of Fernando Pessoa.

*U.S. Utility Patent*

As a third-grade aspiring golfer, I felt saddened at the difficulty elderly people may have experienced when bending over to tee a golf ball. Throughout my adolescence, I developed a solution to deliver a golf ball to the green from below automatically. The complexities of intellectual property law racked my brain, and I had to revise my request to meet standards. I was nonetheless awarded a patent that has informed intellectual property decisions at Kapala.

For example, if you took a leave of absence, faced unusual circumstances in your studies or in your career, you may explain that here. You may also include anything that you feel are important for the Admissions Committee to know. This can include disruptions to your education and/or access to leadership involvement.

**100 words**

As mentioned previously, a medical leave of absence prompted my one-year withdrawal from university. A longstanding health condition combined with the coronavirus pandemic disrupted my first year at university to the point of seeking medical attention mere weeks after beginning the second. That time solely allowed intensive professional care and complicated my undergraduate education, including leadership opportunities, due to ongoing management. Despite the discontinuity, I graduated with a perfect major GPA with honors, was chosen for numerous leadership positions, and spoke to the entire freshman class regarding my experience. I donate to my university to help similar students.1\. Have you ever withdrawn from, been dismissed, suspended, disciplined
by (formally or informally), or placed on probation from an academic
institution (for academic or non-academic reasons)? Do you know of any
pending or unresolved disciplinary matters at an academic institution?
Do you have any reason to believe an academic institution will be
initiating an investigation or disciplinary charge against you in the
future? If yes, provide a detailed explanation here.

**100 words**

# Draft 2

I have only withdrawn from an academic institution on a medical leave of absence; I have not been dismissed, suspended, disciplined, or placed on probation. I am not aware of any pending or potential disciplinary matters or investigations. In Fall 2020, three weeks into the third semester of my undergraduate career, an existing health complication combined with the coronavirus pandemic compelled me to take a medical leave of absence unrelated to academic performance. I was hospitalized, entered longterm treatment, and returned in Fall 2021. Since then, I maintained a perfect GPA, completed treatment, discontinued all medication, and sustained recovery.

# Draft 1

I have only withdrawn from an academic institution; I have not been dismissed, suspended, disciplined, or placed on probation. I am not aware of any pending or potential disciplinary matters or investigations. I have a documented history of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features and a co-occurring Substance Use Disorder, which disrupted my first year at Vanderbilt. In Fall 2020, three weeks into the semester, I experienced a psychotic break unrelated to academics and withdrew. I was hospitalized, entered residential treatment, and returned in Fall 2021. Since then, I maintained 4.0 GPA, completed treatment, discontinued medication, and sustained abstinence-based recovery.

Attach your most recent resume or curriculum vitae. It is critical that this document demonstrates your leadership experiences. PDF or Word document preferred.

![[Schwarzman Leadership CV.pdf]]
Describe one distinct example that illustrates who you are as a leader and how you think about leadership. Normally, the most effective method one can use to convey this example is by presenting a story or narrative. 

As you are drafting your leadership essay, you may draw from your professional, academic, or personal life. Some suggestions of demonstrated leadership you might choose to highlight include:

-   a time you used your intellectual abilities to identify an important
    challenge or opportunity, and how you crafted a solution;

-   an instance when you used your interpersonal skills to inspire a
    team effort towards a solution;

-   an example of when you have pushed through resistance or an obstacle to realize positive change for the community around you.

These are merely examples of how you could organize your thoughts. Do not feel like you need to focus your leadership essay in a way that addresses all or even one of the aforementioned options.  
  
Make sure you talk about the example in detail, highlight areas of personal growth, how you think this important example has shaped you as a leader, and why it will continue to do so in the future.  
  
The most important thing you need the Admissions Committee to understand after reading this essay is a clear view of your authentic thoughts on leadership, and the style you use to accomplish your goals. How you present your ideas on leadership in this essay often tells as much as what you choose to write.

# Draft 1

The smell of Tennessee tobacco filled the room as my friend puffed his pipe recounting a recent visit to the local cemetery to visit his great grandfather's grave. Finding the headstone was impossible, let alone any additional information. His description harkened to an observation by social anthropologist Biao Xiang. Namely, contemporary preoccupations concern the very near and the very far while disregarding "the nearby." Correspondingly, self and world take precedent in neglect of the community. While re-focusing on existing quotidian interactions is possible, what about those that have passed? Indeed, my friend's inability to recall even his great grandfather's name represented a terrifying commonality within the United States. Oral tradition only extends so far, especially within such an individualist culture that atomizes death and the elderly. From our monastery visits as Mahayana Buddhists, we also recognized the value yet difficulty of contemplating impermanence within occidental contexts. 

After empathizing and defining the problem, we ideated pragmatic solutions with philosophical implications. Scrawled post-it notes lined the walls but at first nothing seemed to stick. Given my friend's personal experience, we settled on an individual-level solution: a gravestone-attachable near-field communication tag to preserve one's informational legacy. While my friend seemed pleased, we nonetheless needed customer exposure to assess market fit. Fortunately, my small prototype enabled our successful application to the National Science Foundation Regional Innovation Corps for intensive entrepreneurial training and customer discovery interviews. 

The feedback was tough. Conversations elderly individuals revealed implicit thanatophobia, as few people even mentioned their own death and legacy instead of others. Selling directly to individuals seemed foolish in retrospect. Meanwhile, deathcare professionals described reluctance to manage physical products even with commercial upsides. They already struggled to navigate engagement and practices like cremation. The societal implications ultimately lagged behind questions of profit. As an idealistic leader, I needed to meter my philosophical leanings or risk alienating those I serve. 

The criticism nonetheless did not deter but impel our curiosity. I started to develop a software solution from scratch geared towards organizations that leveraged geospatial technology and artificial intelligence to digitize entire burial sites. Refining the product unlocked partnership opportunities. Even with functioning software, the challenge remained to communicate the value to an aging, tech-averse crowd. Remembering the customer discovery interviews, we curtailed technical language and focused on business-level pain points. An outdoor tools company eventually licensed our software to build an industry-specific product for holding flags and wreaths. We later secured several pilot projects with cemeteries themselves including the locally prestigious Nashville City Cemetery. 

These wins were refreshing even at a distance. I had been working in Mexico as a Fulbright Scholar while actively developing our software on the side. Though separation may seem to spell disaster for founders, my experiences proved invaluable in shaping the business. I discovered ample opportunities like taking innovation classes, interviewing founders for work, or bringing my startup to my university's entrepreneurship hub. However, the most significant breakthroughs involved first-hand cultural exposure to Mexican traditions. Day of the Dead mobilized the whole country to reconnect with late loved ones in cemeteries lined with marigolds, tissue paper, and sweet bread. As innovation evidently existed beyond the U.S., so too did ancestral connection exist beyond Mexico. It just needed cultural adaptation to flourish. Seeking experiences beyond my professional specialization proved vital to the company and our spirit. That realization revitalized our courage to present at a funeral industry trade show where dozens of companies expressed purchase intentions. 

With the first customers on the horizon, we incorporated under the name Kapala. The etymology symbolizes impermanence and occurs within both the Proto-Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan language branches. Like the word, I too strive to straddle distinct cultural contexts as a change-maker. Though funerary practices are ubiquitous, Mexico and China are perhaps the strongest exemplars of ancestor devotion and dedicated holidays for cemetery visits. The former already shaped my trajectory, while the latter is the ideal next destination. Tomb-Sweeping Day and the Double Ninth Festival epitomize the ancestral connection Kapala seeks to kindle, while Buddhist culture that inspired the ethos pervades from the three teachings. The Chinese super-app and mini-program ecosystem would be a first-hand lesson on app design. Leadership training, global peers, and immersion in China would complement these drives. Regardless, the ongoing evolution of the startup means that existing growth continues to compound. My commitment is measurable: cemeteries mapped, records validated, families reconnected, caretakers paid. I will keep honoring the nearby so remembrance outlasts convenience and collective wisdom endures rather than vanishing like smoke.

This section is an opportunity to showcase up to five leadership roles
that illustrate your demonstrated leadership experience. For each entry,
include a concise explanation of why the role is significant to your leadership profile, as well as your distinct contribution, outcome, or initiative. These activities will be displayed in order by the most recent start date.

**75 words per entry**

Kapala
*Technical Founder*

My co-founder and I bonded one evening about the paucity of information at burial sites. We prototyped a gravestone-attachable chip and conducted customer interviews that directed us to visitor-facing cemetery digitization. Though I built computers and software growing up, creating the full stack from scratch proved monumental. The software ultimately enabled pilot projects and tradeshow participations that attracted initial customers. I currently lead product development while wearing many hats.

Lodestone Ventures
*Venture Capital Analyst*

I was selected among peers for the one open spot, seeking experience with international capital markets. Assessing business models, sourcing deals at tech conferences, and meeting founders were all exhilarating tasks. Yet, internal processes for handling the deal flow demonstrated an organizational need. I utilized human-centered design to develop investor-approved proprietary backend software for managing startup prospects. I was voted to receive the Impact Award for my cohort, with the software still in use today.

Association of Recovery in Higher Education
*Board Member*

I was elected to the board, aflame at the start of my tenure. The prior CEO had been fired amidst internal controversy. While serving on the governance and finance committees, I helped rewrite institutional policy to define better boundaries for the future leader. The process did not mitigate my original contributions. I setup channels to incorporate student voices into the decision-making process and co-founded the still enduring research committee to integrate the latest recovery research.

Accelerator
*Lead Consultant*

I entered Accelerator as a consultant to find my niche within a business career. I was elected to lead consulting for a Fortune 500, though working with a startup and prototyping an app for an innovation-oriented multinational corporation kindled my present passion for innovation. Senior leadership selected our team for excellence in research. I was awarded team MVP twice and the highest 360 feedback scores of all consultants that summer.

Nada-Winchester International Symposium
*Delegate for the United States*

I was chosen from my entire class as one of two United States representatives at a global symposium in Japan for select young leaders across a dozen countries. My delegation exchanged monthly essays with our international peers and delivered a presentation on nuclear energy at the Tennessee Oak Ridge laboratory. All nations present collectively produced a proposal addressing society and the natural world. A convincing talk even kickstarted my conversion to vegetarianism.

# Alternatives

Vanderbilt Recovery Support
*Member / Speaker*

Selected as Vanderbilt’s Recovery Ambassador, I delivered campus talks to incoming freshmen, residence halls, and local high schools on addiction, mental health, and help seeking. I partnered with Student Affairs and Counseling to design programming, trained peer facilitators, and created resource guides requested by faculty. My outreach reached thousands of students and parents across multiple events each semester.

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
*Crisis Counselor*

I guided hundreds of visitors in crisis to safety through voice and text conversation. Lived experience within the mental health system enabled me to empathize and understand the resources available. I collaborated with new volunteers, organized follow-ups, and coordinated intervention when necessary. 

Vanderbilt Student Government
*Senator*

I was elected on a platform of protecting a decades-old language immersion dormitory that Vanderbilt ultimately cancelled. I learned a lesson in idealism when institutional policy trumped student initiatives in terms of the protection sought, though I still passed  initiatives with my fellow area representative like improving opportunities for dining workers. I hosted town halls with my area's student body to ensure I represented their voice on other important matters.

Endeavor
*Insights Project Lead*

Repeat of previous?

Pabmasambhava Buddhist Center
*Learning Dharma Skills Volunteer***Professional Experience**

List *up to two* of your most recent full-time work experience in
chronological order. Do not list part-time work, internships, or
volunteer opportunities; these may be highlighted in your Resume/CV.   If you have military experience (military student, active duty, or
veteran), include these in this section. If you do not have full-time work experience, please do not fill out this section.

Kapala
*Technical Founder*

Endeavor Mexico

**100 words**

My ideal trajectory is a founder-facilitator-funder who connects the United States, Mexico, and China. I require formal leadership development to scale a globally inspired startup, immersion to bridge distinct ecosystems, and interdisciplinary exposure to understand the macro-scale. Schwarzman is where I learn what I cannot simulate as a startup founder, like how Chinese super-apps distribute products and ancestor-veneration norms shape funeral practices. Researching addiction inculcated the value of lived experience, so I first intend to incorporate the experience as a founder like with Mexico before playing a systemic role. The latter would entail bridging ecosystems through trilateral networks and angel investments.

### Draft 1

Freemasonry taught me to use simple tools to measure complicated work. For instance, the square for fairness, the level for humility, and the compasses for restraint. The tools are symbolic, but the discipline is practical. Because or rather in spite of being among the youngest members, I am given such intergenerational wisdom with the expectation of better serving my fellow human beings. Those lessons have shaped how I lead, employing symbol in conjunction with logic to navigate the world with compassion, much like the Buddhist philosophy to which I also ascribe.

# Draft 2

Of all the myriad locations across Mexico City, my friends from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México were most eager to show me Chinatown and the Chapultepec Zoo's Xin Xin, the only giant panda not on loan from China. "If you can speak Chinese, you can choose your own salary," remarked Alejandro, alluding to the abundant binational economics and glaring knowledge gap. The conversation continued into their preferred study abroad destinations, not in the United States or Europe but Asia. The Beijing Education Commission began a partnership with their university months later. These trends became increasingly evident at my job researching entrepreneurship within emerging markets. "Unicorns," technology startups valued over one billion, no longer concentrated solely within the United States but the world with China as the runner-up. Amidst such personal revelations, it was hardly surprising that my coworker was applying to the Schwarzman Scholars inspired by a previous colleague. Her description had me hooked. 

I was attracted to China in high school from policy debate and Mahayana Buddhism, but my college studies pulled me towards South America. Similar to Mexico, my immersion across the continent illuminated the false dichotomy with exposure to BRICS in Brazil and the Belt and Road in Peru. Indeed, bridging Latin American and Chinese business ecosystems carried enormous potential. Mexico seemed hospitable to startups yet dependent upon increasingly absent U.S. infrastructure. China appeared opportune but poorly understood by outsiders. Realizing this global potential would thus necessitate multilateral leadership.

Like Mexico City, Beijing is the startup epicenter of its country. The Zhongguancun technology hub houses giants like Lenovo, ByteDance, and of course Tsinghua University. Enrolling in the latter would grant privileged positioning at the heart of China's entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially for a founder like myself. Courses like the Entrepreneurial Strategy Modules would help navigate complex startup landscape, building upon my undergraduate innovation studies. The X-Lab at Tsinghua would provide insights to my growing startup, much like at EPIC Lab did at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. The likeminded company of founders would always be nearby at TusPark. With the Schwarzman Scholars program, I would also pursue an optional internship like Tecnológico de Monterrey's Innovation Hub Tec-China to build upon my background.

Growing a company through trilateral input would unlock unprecedented understanding of the ecosystems to link. I would first incorporate such knowledge domestically before returning abroad as a conduit. Whether persisting as founder or transitioning to facilitator, staying in startups would beget moving to San Francisco as the ideal transnational juncture. The latter would springboard into roles assisting software startups with internationalization, as U.S. culture and language still predicate international business. I would leverage networks within Mexico City and Beijing to create corridors amongst institutions filling the aforementioned gaps; these pathways would invariably bridge capital markets, paving the way for venture capital opportunities. As China, Mexico, and the United States continue to occupy top trade positions with one another, the Schwarzman Scholars would catalyze my ability to connect innovation ecosystems.

# Draft 1

Dr. Xiang's theory echoed my pandemic experience; I became isolated and paranoid in a concurrent struggle with addiction, an intergenerational malady inherited from my Latvian grandparents yet unknown to my teenage self. I danced with death but remained ignorant until faced with hospitalization. Besides biological and psychological interventions, the ultimate treatment was reconstructing the everyday---people, places, and things. Joining a recovery community checked all the boxes and eventually facilitated related leadership roles as a crisis counselor, researcher, and board member. Recovery nonetheless comprises not only the material but the spiritual. 

Though my childhood home contained nothing more than a jade Budai statue, I was drawn to Mahayana Buddhism as an adolescent through the works of Chan master Thich Nhat Hanh. The bodhisattva ideal of compassion for all beings deeply resonated and helped during hospitalization. That healing ultimately empowered me to spend college summers volunteering at a monastery,

Recovery and Buddhism accustomed me to the nearby and impermanence, which represent the focal point of my current trajectory. My foundation in the startup ecosystem fostered my own 

Rooting innovation within tradition is essential

Developing the software in Mexico, 

Ask Tennesseans what makes their state so great, and you get answers like country music, hot chicken, or southern hospitality. My go-to answer is the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse first established to research nuclear energy. Sensitivity now metered my pride as I presented the benefits of molten salt reactors in Japan, a country devastated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdown just years prior. As one of two delegates representing the United States to a global audience, my conduct reflected my country. What about meltdowns? Weaponization? Historical baggage? asked representatives from China, India, Singapore, and more. It was rewarding to champion safer advancements but more so to contextualize my perspective. Besides sustainable innovation, the symposium catalyzed my intrigue for vegetarianism, Buddhism, and Asia more broadly. The former two contrasted with my bible-belt barbecue upbringing, though a panel on animal products and a monk on alms round impressed me deeply.

I am sitting in the meditation hall at my local Buddhist temple. Though you would never guess, it resides in my hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. People are always suprised when they discover I practice given my southern roots, though I have introduced newcomers and heritage Buddhists alike to this space. 

The only thing Buddhist in my childhood was this jade Budai statue, supposedly from China. A Chan Buddhist master drew me to the tradition, after I found Western philosophy unsatisfying for my existential unrest. I later spent my college summers volunteering at a monastery that presented the bodhisattva ideal of boundless compassion for all beings.

Even putting aside the metaphysics, I was so moved of such profound altruism. It has become my north star throughout my diverse pursuits, most recently building software to encourage meditation on impermanence. Akin to this small but mighty temple, these aspirations take inspiration from those grander in scale. Despite the seeming impossibility, like the bodhisattva tasked with helping uncountable beings, I do not give up. I think back to that curious southern boy who saw the lines even if he couldn't connect the dots.
