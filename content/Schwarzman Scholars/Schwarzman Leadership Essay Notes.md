Describe one distinct example that illustrates who you are as a leader and how you think about leadership. Normally, the most effective method one can use to convey this example is by presenting a story or narrative. 

As you are drafting your leadership essay, you may draw from your professional, academic, or personal life. Some suggestions of demonstrated leadership you might choose to highlight include:

-   a time you used your intellectual abilities to identify an important
challenge or opportunity, and how you crafted a solution;



-   an instance when you used your interpersonal skills to inspire a
team effort towards a solution;

-   an example of when you have pushed through resistance or an obstacle to realize positive change for the community around you.

These are merely examples of how you could organize your thoughts. Do not feel like you need to focus your leadership essay in a way that addresses all or even one of the aforementioned options.  

Make sure you talk about the example in detail, highlight areas of personal growth, how you think this important example has shaped you as a leader, and why it will continue to do so in the future.  

The most important thing you need the Admissions Committee to understand after reading this essay is a clear view of your authentic thoughts on leadership, and the style you use to accomplish your goals. How you present your ideas on leadership in this essay often tells as much as what you choose to write.
