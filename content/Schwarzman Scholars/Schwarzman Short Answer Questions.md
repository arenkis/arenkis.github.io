# 1. How do you see spending a year at Schwarzman College in Beijing and joining the Schwarzman Scholars network for life advancing your specific leadership goals and future impact?

## Draft 3

Something about better serving software company, going back to graduate school, working in teh ecosystem, incorporate chinese philosophy into the design, 

## Draft 2

I intend to rekindle cultural engagement with death by bridging practices from exemplars. Living in Buddhist monastic environments inspired the core philosophy, and Mexico's Day of The Dead transformed those ideas into a startup. The only culture as emphatic of ancestor worship and Mahayana Buddhism is China. The only program as tailored to innovation leadership is Schwarzman. I will study local funerary traditions through Deep Dive fieldwork in Mandarin, preparing for capstone research on China's aging population and limited urban burial space. Business mentorship coupled with technological internship will translate theory to practice. Then I can best serve my company.

## Draft 1

My ideal trajectory is a founder-facilitator-funder who connects the United States, Mexico, and China. I require formal leadership development to scale a globally inspired startup, immersion to bridge distinct ecosystems, and interdisciplinary exposure to understand the macro-scale. Schwarzman is where I learn what I cannot simulate as a startup founder, like how Chinese super-apps distribute products and ancestor-veneration norms shape funeral practices. Researching addiction inculcated the value of lived experience, so I first intend to incorporate the experience as a founder like with Mexico before playing a systemic role. The latter would entail bridging ecosystems through trilateral networks and angel investments.

### Draft 3

My background in Freemasonry shapes my leadership approach. Its wisdom attainable only by degrees emulates the character building required of leaders. Fraternal initiations like development programs act as tipping points. Masonic working tools illustrate necessary virtues, like the square for ethical behavior and the chisel for self refinement. As I discovered from creating cemetery technology, these principles are so significant that members opt for Masonic funerals. I thus embed these concepts into the digital and social architecture of my organization, since practicing spiritual principles extends to all my affairs. I look forward to exploring the tradition through its Chinese branches.

### Draft 1

Freemasonry taught me to use simple tools to measure complicated work. For instance, the square for fairness, the level for humility, and the compasses for restraint. The tools are symbolic, but the discipline is practical. Because or rather in spite of being among the youngest members, I am given such intergenerational wisdom with the expectation of better serving my fellow human beings. Those lessons have shaped how I lead, employing symbol in conjunction with logic to navigate the world with compassion, much like the Buddhist philosophy to which I also ascribe.
