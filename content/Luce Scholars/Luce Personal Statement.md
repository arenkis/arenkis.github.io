# Draft 3

Ask Tennesseans what makes the state great and you will hear country music or hot chicken. My answer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse created to research nuclear energy. As a student delegate in Japan, I presented the promise of molten salt reactors to a global audience that had lived through Fukushima. Colleagues from China, India, and Singapore asked about meltdowns, weaponization, and history. Sensitivity now metered my pride, as I championed safer advancements while honoring local experience. That symposium also opened three lasting threads in my life: a pull toward Asia, a passion for innovation, and an embrace of Buddhism. Luce is where these threads intertwine.

Disruption and service have forged my journey to that goal. The coronavirus pandemic and my struggle with addiction prompted sudden withdrawal from university. As a Latvian-American with immigrant relatives who suffered the same illness, I considered this possibility real but distant. Recovery fortunately enabled my return one year later bolstered by leadership positions to stay accountable. I served on a nonprofit board, led mental health research, represented students in the senate, and staffed crisis lines. Self-reliance can turn inward, and service keeps it pointed toward others. As evidenced by Luce Scholars, certain values become useful only in practice.

I tested those values across languages and borders. Fellowships took me to Peru and Brazil, where Spanish and Portuguese turned strangers into teachers. Studying Peruvian indigenous communities contextualized various pathways to social impact, while speaking Spanish unlocked local conversations at recovery meetings on themes discussed in class. Honing similar abilities in Brazil, I bonded with my host mother about Spiritism, discovered Nipo-Brazilian history in Japantown, and read Buddhist scriptures in Portuguese on a meditation retreat. These extended cross-cultural dwellings were daunting though manageable compared to exploring another religion without understanding its language. I began a multi-month work exchange at a domestic Tibetan Buddhist monastery that culminated in formal lay commitment persisting to this day. The experience also planted a fascination with death that would take root in unexpected ways. My embrace of these diverse perspectives did not afford privileged understanding but radical humility, symbolizing profound cultural oceans in which I had only waded. My later backpacking Southeast Asia reaffirmed that broad yet short exposure only provided so much. These Asian tangents would require submersion to deepen. Few options seemed available besides my ongoing independent engagements.

Professionally, my adolescence of nuclear energy, patent creation, and computer building blossomed into innovative inclinations. I led consulting projects for a startup to devise digital strategy and for Nissan to prototype a micro-mobility app. My tenure in venture capital involved creating award-winning internal software while self-sourcing deals that turned into term sheets. Before graduation, I pioneered a National Science Foundation-supported project for digitizing cemeteries. This momentum culminated in a Fulbright fellowship working in Mexico with Endeavor, where I interviewed founders of global companies and spearheaded entrepreneurial ecosystem research. I even sought opportunities beyond my placement like consulting for the Mexican government regarding a new airport. These leadership roles accelerated my impact, yet I yearned for development opportunities to realize my fullest potential.

My biggest initiative that year involved developing that scientific project into a startup called Kapala. The word symbolizes impermanence and occurs within both the Proto-Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan language branches. Like the etymology, I too strive to straddle distinct cultural contexts as a change-maker. Realizing this ideal requires long-term Asian immersion, local work, and formal leadership training. My forays into each positions the Luce as the perfect structure I cannot assemble otherwise: in-country language study, bespoke placement with development grants, and leadership workshops.

My entrepreneurial journey with Kapala and Fulbright has already demonstrated how cultural immersion transforms professional understanding. Just as witnessing Mexico's Day of the Dead shifted our focus from individual to community legacies, Asia's profound traditions around death and ancestor veneration offer even deeper lessons. China's Qingming Festival exemplifies how entire families care for memorials, while Japan's Obon celebrations welcome ancestral spirits back home through elaborate rituals. Korean jesa ancestral rites and Vietnam's ornate home altars similarly demonstrate how death becomes woven into the fabric of daily life, not to mention the region-wide Buddhist influence advocating impermanence. To bridge the gap between technological innovation and meaningful remembrance, I must understand how Asia's dynamic societies navigate this intersection. The Luce would provide the cultural immersion necessary to incorporate these time-tested approaches. I would launch pilot projects if appropriate, honoring rather than disrupting the profound ways Asian communities maintain ancestral connections.

Complementing such cultural immersion, my multifaceted background aligns me with plentiful placements. In Thailand, ChangeFusion would let me extend my venture capital background to incubation and impact investing. Ashoka India would likewise deepen this entrepreneurial understanding, teaching me the social dimensions of changemaking. I could even seek additional organizations untouc

hed by Luce Scholars. My Buddhist background could shape community education at the Nepalese Rangjung Yeshe Institute, given my connection to its previous Principal. The Beijing-based Innovation Hub Tec-China would benefit from my Mexico experience as a Sino-Mexican university collaboration. I could alternatively bring my early-stage, government-oriented startup experience to GovTech Singapore. Besides such professional commitments, I would remain involved with local recovery and Buddhist organizations wherever possible while travelling to visit other cohort members, recognizing the value of such special peers.

After Luce I would better lead my startup by leveraging experiential insights from Asia. Encountering cultural approaches to death would shape the design philosophy, while growing leadership capabilities would empower my executive responsibilities. The company would ideally come full circle with Asian expansion. I would then pursue pragmatic Asia-oriented graduate studies like the Lauder MBA/MA to continue building Luce year professional and lingual competencies. This mastery would progress into a role connecting innovation ecosystems, as an investor supporting intercultural ventures. All such efforts prove untenable without the Luce. This moment represents the perfect intersection of my preparation and Asia's calling. I would weave those three threads from Japan into a unified cord, pulling me into a future that seemed elusive before.

Colleagues from China, India, and Singapore asked about meltdowns, weaponization, and history. Sensitivity now metered my pride, as I championed safer advancements while honoring local experience. That symposium also opened three lasting threads in my life: a curiosity for Asia, a passion for sustainable innovation, and a Buddhist lens for service. Luce is where these threads intertwine.

Disruption and service have forged my journey to that goal. The coronavirus pandemic and my struggle with addiction prompted sudden withdrawal from university. As the grandchild of Latvian immigrants who suffered the same illness, I considered this possibility real but distant. I returned a year later with a new way of life involving 12-step recovery, vegetarianism, and leadership positions that kept me accountable to others. I staffed crisis lines, consulted writers, represented students in the senate, and spearheaded recovery research. The lesson was simple. Self-reliance can turn inward, and service keeps it pointed toward others. As evidenced by Luce Scholars, certain values become useful only in practice. 

I tested those values across languages and borders. Grants took me to Peru and Brazil, where Spanish and Portuguese turned strangers into teachers. Studying Peruvian indigenous communities contextualized myriad pathways to social impact, while speaking Spanish unlocked local conversations at recovery meetings on themes discussed in class. Honing similar abilities in Brazil, I bonded with my host mother about Spiritism, discovered Nipo-Brazilian history in Japantown, and read Buddhist scriptures in Portuguese on a meditation retreat. These extended cross-cultural dwellings were daunting though manageable compared to exploring another religion without understanding its language. Back home, I began a multi-month work exchange at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery that culminated in formal lay commitment and daily practice that persists years later.

Before graduation, I pioneered a National Science Foundation project for digitizing the maps, memorials, and markets of cemeteries. This innovative and intercultural momentum culminated in a Fulbright fellowship working in Mexico with Endeavor, where I interviewed founders of global companies and spearheaded entrepreneurial ecosystem research.

These leadership roles accelerated my impact, yet the back of my mind yearned for formal development to realize that extra mile.

My biggest initiative that year involved developing that scientific project into a startup called Kapala. The word symbolizes impermanence and occurs within both the Proto-Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan language branches. Like the etymology, I too strive to straddle distinct cultural contexts as a change-maker. To realize this ideal, I require formal leadership development, longterm Asian immersion, and first-hand experience. My forays into each area positions the Luce Scholars as the perfect catalyst, whether learning from lamas in Kathmandu, practicing Portuguese in Macau, or assisting startups in Singapore. The program offers the scaffolding I cannot assemble alone: a guided placement, language study, sector exposure, and an unparalleled cohort. I aim to grow from capable generalist to Asia-grounded operator leveraging a multinational, multilingual background. 

Many existing placements already align with my profile. The Thailand-based ChangeFusion would let me work at the intersection of incubation, impact investing, and community platforms. My contributions in product thinking and research discipline would complement systemic approaches to social enterprise. Ashoka India would deepen this entrepreneurial understanding as well, teaching me to scale impact across countries. I could even seek additional organizations untouched by Luce Scholars. The Nepalese Rangjung Yeshe Institute would allow me to apply my Tibetan language and Buddhist background in service of translation, digital resources, and community education. In Beijing, Innovation Hub Tec-China would let me build practical bridges between China, Mexico, and the United States by convening founders and investors across my networks. Alternatively, I could bring my early-stage, government-oriented startup experience to GovTech Singapore. My pragmatic, multicultural skillset prepares me for various placements even with adversity guaranteed. Besides such professional commitment, I would remain involved with local recovery and Buddhist organizations wherever possible. 

After Luce I would continue my startup by leveraging experiential insights from Asia combined with those from Latin America. The formal leadership development would empower me to understand the academic context and lead my company into later stages. I would then pursue Asia-oriented graduate studies like the Lauder MBA/MA to keep building Luce year language competencies. That foundation would enable me to move into a platform role supporting the international innovation ecosystem, bolstered by local networks and global peers from the Luce. I would ultimately aim to give back by supporting global founders as an angel investor and mentor. Such investment encourages intercultural communication from visiting the other side, establishing a foothold, and developing mutually understandable ways of interacting.

Perspective has taught me to contextualize. Innovation has moved me to act. Buddhism has implored me to serve. Luce is perfect for people like me to mobilize these tendencies alongside peers who challenge and guide. The program would tie those three threads into a unified cord pulling me into a future that seemed distant until now.

# Draft 1.5 (ChatGPT feedback incorporation)

Ask Tennesseans what makes the state great and you will hear country music or hot chicken. My answer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse created to research nuclear energy. As a student delegate in Japan, I presented the promise of molten salt reactors to a global audience that had lived through Fukushima. Colleagues from China, India, and Singapore asked about meltdowns, weaponization, and history. I learned to argue for safer technology while honoring local experience. That week also opened two lasting threads in my life, a curiosity for Asia and a Buddhist lens for service. Luce is where these threads become a practitioner’s path.

I have built cross-cultural and technical muscles in the United States and Mexico, yet I lack structured mentorship and immersion in Asia. Luce provides a mentored placement, language learning, and sector exposure that I cannot assemble on my own. I want to contribute as an operator who ships useful tools, and I need Luce to accelerate that shift from capable generalist to Asia-grounded practitioner.

My journey to that goal was forged through disruption and service. During the pandemic I withdrew from university to recover from addiction. I returned a year later with different habits and priorities, including vegetarianism, Buddhist practice, and service positions that kept me accountable to others. I staffed crisis lines, consulted writers, represented students in the senate, and spearheaded research on collegiate recovery. The lesson was simple. Self-reliance can turn inward, and service keeps it pointed toward others. Luce fits because it rewards values that become useful only in practice.

I then tested those values across languages and borders. Grants took me to Peru and Brazil, where Spanish and Portuguese turned strangers into teachers. In Brazil I learned Portuguese in homestays, joined recovery meetings, and compared Spiritism and Buddhism with my host mother over dinner. Back home, a work exchange at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery led to formal lay commitment and daily practice. These experiences did not make me a scholar of religion, they made me a better teammate who can listen across difference. Luce will let me keep learning by contributing on the ground in Buddhist-influenced contexts.

Professionally, I moved from analysis to building. I prototyped a micromobility app for a multinational, then joined a venture firm to research companies and ship internal tooling. Before graduation I stood up a small National Science Foundation project and later co-founded Kapala, a platform that digitizes cemeteries so families can find and honor their dead. The product combines mapping, data, and human-centered design. While on a Fulbright in Mexico with Endeavor, I interviewed founders and led ecosystem research that informed public and private partners. Those months taught me to work in another country’s cadence, in another language, with executive stakeholders who needed decisions framed, not just data summarized. Luce will build on that binational training by placing me inside an Asian organization where real users and peers depend on my output.

Recovery and Fulbright taught me the value of lived experience. Luce directly closes my development gap. I need structured mentorship in leadership, social impact, and venture at Asian institutions that translate ideas into delivery. Luce already offers several past placements aligned with my profile. In Thailand, ChangeFusion would let me work at the intersection of incubation, impact investing, and community platforms. I would learn system-change approaches to social enterprise while contributing product thinking and research discipline. Ashoka India would deepen my practitioner network in social entrepreneurship. I would learn how to scale impact through fellow support and youth pipelines while contributing lightweight tools and evidence synthesis for fellows and partners. Organizations 

The Nepalese Rangjung Yeshe Institute would allow me to apply my Tibetan language training in service of translation, digital resources, and community education. I would learn preservation workflows and partner etiquette and I would add geospatial and product skills to help make texts and teachings more accessible. In Beijing, the Innovation Hub Tec-China would let me build practical bridges between China, Mexico, and the United States by convening founders and investors across my networks. I would learn cross-border commercialization dynamics and contribute binational market navigation for teams entering the Americas. In Singapore, GovTech would let me bring early-stage startup experience to public service delivery. I would learn service design at national scale and agile collaboration with regulators while contributing shipped product experience, disciplined user research, and clear writing for technical and nontechnical audiences.

I measure progress by what I ship and who it serves. During Luce I aim to deliver three outcomes with my host. First, a shipped product or process improvement with documented user impact. Second, a short public brief that maps useful bridges between Asian and Americas startup ecosystems in my host’s domain. Third, a small open dataset or toolkit that outlives my fellowship. These deliverables keep me honest about value creation, and Luce’s structured mentorship will keep me accountable for quality.

After Luce I will apply what I learned in two stages. First, I will continue building Kapala with contributions from Asia and Latin America, incorporating local cultural practices and government workflows. Second, I will move into a platform role that supports founders at the intersection of civic needs and sustainable business, with a focus on people in recovery. Over time I plan to back founders who build quietly useful things. Luce is the catalyst that turns conviction into capability in Asia.

The throughline across my path is consistent. International perspective taught me to contextualize innovation. A Buddhist lens keeps me accountable to the people affected by my work. A practitioner mindset moves me from analysis to delivery. Luce is built for people like me to become more useful, faster, alongside peers who will challenge and guide me. I will bring to the cohort a binational foundation, product discipline, beginner’s humility in Asia, and a bias for building. With Luce’s placement, mentorship, and regional immersion, I will become the kind of operator who helps institutions deliver with care.

# Draft 1

Ask Tennesseans what makes their state so great, and you get answers like country music, hot chicken, or southern hospitality. My go-to answer is the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse first established to research nuclear energy. Sensitivity now metered my pride as I presented the benefits of molten salt reactors in Japan, a country devastated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdown just years prior. As one of two delegates representing the United States to a global audience, my conduct reflected my country. What about meltdowns? Weaponization? Historical baggage? asked representatives from China, India, Singapore, and more. It was rewarding to champion safer advancements but more so to contextualize my perspective. Besides sustainable innovation, the symposium catalyzed my intrigue for vegetarianism, Buddhism, and Asia more broadly. The former two contrasted with my bible-belt barbecue upbringing, though a panel on animal products and a monk on alms round impressed me deeply.

College was bound to amplify this development until macro- and micro-level black swan events shifted the course. The coronavirus pandemic and my struggle with addiction prompted sudden withdrawal from university. My shutdown coincided with that of the world. As the grandchild of Latvian immigrants who suffered the same illness, I considered this possibility real but distant. Suddenly I found my walls colorless and shoes laceless. Healing required not only medical intervention but creative destruction. I replaced substance-use with abstinence, meat-eating with vegetarianism, and agnosticism with Buddhism. The former especially changed my life because working a 12-step program taught me how self-reliance can conduce to self-destruction. Focusing on others was paramount to long-term recovery; I accepted service positions like secretary or meeting chair within a nearby group. This radical transformation also permitted re-entering university one year later.

My spirit emerged from its shell like faces from their masks. I began with stability to ease my return, dedicating an undergraduate major to Spanish in continuation of my adolescent aptitude from a summer in Spain. On-campus activities blossomed into leadership opportunities; previous hardships fueled present service. I became a student government senator to represent my language immersion dormitory, served as a board member for the association that oversees all collegiate recovery programs because of my involvement, and spearheaded cross-cultural addiction research after demonstrated academic performance. I concurrently worked as a writing consultant and crisis counselor to serve others at an individual level. Though not essential for service, a representative, researcher, or counselor with lived experience such as myself could comprehend subtleties like code switching. These engagements all demonstrated that my past did not prohibit but redefined success. Such resilience permeated my internal world even amidst rapid external changes.

This assimilation laid the foundation for growth off campus. Recovery and re-integration filled every waking second, yet I yearned to develop those curiosities ignited in Japan. Such impulse brought me to a domestic Tibetan Buddhist monastery for its work exchange program. Entering another culture with so little experience was daunting, let alone another religion. Compassion is fortunately central in this case; the monastic residents offered hospitality rivaling even the most generous southerner. Weeks of volunteer work soon intertwined with intense teachings alongside veteran practitioners, resulting in "taking refuge" under the abbot---committing to Buddhist living. Thus began my daily study and practice that persists years later, whether via scripture recitations, group meditations, or extended retreats. This spiritual calling brought dreams of experiencing Buddhist cultures, but academic pursuits pulled me elsewhere.

My inward odyssey mirrored outward exploration. Spanish and Portuguese literature filled my shelves concomitant with multiple language grants and programs in Peru and Brazil. Traveling abroad carried not only educational but personal significance, as I had not done so since beginning recovery. Studying Peruvian indigenous communities offered parallels to both Tibet and Brazil, as my class discussed diverse pathways to empowerment at the intersection of modernity and tradition. Moreover, speaking Spanish enabled attending recovery meetings and conversing with locals regarding nuanced questions like assimilation and autonomy. I sought the same ability in Brazil, so I dove into Portuguese study. Before long, I was bonding with my Brazilian host mother about Spiritism, discovering Nipo-Brazilian history in Japantown, and reading Buddhist scriptures in Portuguese on a meditation retreat. I grew this curiosity on return through efforts like formal independent study.

Such drive for new ideas complemented my innovative inclinations born from creating a patent and building computers in high school. I honed this interest in college through professional opportunities, like building a prototype micro-mobility mobile app for Nissan during a summer stint in consulting. I enjoyed leading this process so much that I also created customer management software for my next job at a venture capital firm, all the while sourcing deals that turned into term sheets. This creative impulse carried over to personal projects, as I-Corps funding enabled developing a startup idea before graduation. Reconnecting with my prior yearning, I backpacked Southeast Asia that summer, where the broad yet short exposure left me eager for more.

This innovative and intercultural momentum culminated in a Fulbright fellowship working in Mexico with Endeavor, where I interviewed founders of global companies and spearheaded entrepreneurial ecosystem research. I sought opportunities beyond work like a consulting for the Mexican government regarding a new airport. I also invested considerable time coding for that startup idea an application to digitize cemeteries, named Kapala after the Buddhist term signifying impermanence. Following my time in Mexico, we landed our first customer, and I received a scholarship for the three-year Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy program beginning this fall.

Despite studying and undertaking leadership, I lack a formal development program to magnify my abilities like I-Corps did for Kapala. The Luce offers this foundation and Asian immersion needed for my aspirations, whether learning from lamas in Kathmandu, practicing Portuguese in Macau, or assisting startups in Singapore. My multinational, multilingual background would regardless foster multipolar understanding. I will use the experience to bridge U.S., Latin American, and Asian startup ecosystems as a business leader before becoming a funder supporting founders in recovery. I will also ordain as a lay-monastic intermediary to spread Buddhist teachings.
