In a 1-2 minute video, show an object or location that holds personal
significance. Use this as an opportunity to share something about
yourself that ==isn’t reflected elsewhere in your application.==

Record using only your mobile phone or laptop camera—do **not** use
professional equipment or editing tools, as points will be deducted if
these are detected. The technical quality of the video is secondary to
the content, so focus on your message. 

Be creative, honest, funny—most importantly, be yourself and let your
personality shine!

Growing up in Nashville has afforded me many special places throughout my lifetime. I am sitting in one of the most fascinating, John B Garrett Lodge #711. For those unfamiliar with the world's largest fraternal organization, Freemasonry promotes universal co by inward virtue and outward service. What looks like an unassuming interior in fact houses generations of community involvement extending even to the founding fathers. I passed many such lodges while growing up, completely unaware, until I knocked on its doors at the end of college.

Despite the geographic proximity, it could not have felt more foreign. I was the youngest  by decades and surrounded by indecipherable symbols.
