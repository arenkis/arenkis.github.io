# Luce Scholars

_**Sakaria Auelua-Toomey, Luce Scholar**_  
The sense I got from the Skype interview, which lasted a little over an hour, is that the Luce Scholars Program Director really wanted to get to know me as a person beyond my application. The interview didn’t seem very structured; rather, the questions were guided by things I mentioned in my responses.

The Director was genuinely curious about my background; he asked me questions regarding my involvement in the Air Force, my research experience in Thailand, how it was growing up as a half-Samoan, half-Irish, about a gap I had between high school and college, how I see my role as a minority in academia, and mentors whom have inspired me, among other things.

My perception was that the Director wanted to figure out if I would fare well and succeed in Asia if selected for the program. He seemed interested in learning about my interactions with others, how others perceived me, and how I overcame adversity and hardship in my life.

When asked about my interest in Asia and where I hoped to be placed and gain from the experience if selected, I talked about potential placements in South Korea or Thailand, backing these choices up with my research experiences; however, I also stated that I was open-minded. This showed that I have a sense of what direction I wanted to head toward but am still able to remain flexible and essentially willing to learn about a new and different culture than my own.

I think the personal history that really provided me with a grounded understanding and therefore motivation to increase minority representation also shined favorably. And lastly, I felt that bringing out who I am and really being myself helped me in this interview.

_**Alexandra McDougle, Luce Scholar**_  
Luce is unique in that they’re really looking to invest in people rather than résumés. The interview is really tailored to your essay and your background. The Program Director focused primarily on my long-term goals. He wanted to know about my plans for a PhD. He asked if I would be willing to take out loans for graduate studies if need be and I said that I was, but that I also wanted to work as a TA with French departments and exhaust all sources of funding before I depended on loans.  He asked me what schools I wanted to go to for my PhD.  I said that I was still looking into programs because I wanted to get more experience in the field before I made definite choices, but that I had been following the schools of some of the anthropologists whose work I’d like to follow  (Sabrina Agarwal- Berkeley, Zoe Crossland- Columbia and Clea Koff- Stanford and Arizona).

He also asked personal questions that threw me off a bit. He asked if my GPA would stop me from getting in to schools that I wanted. I said that I understood my GPA would be something I’d have to overcome but that I was working hard to get experience in the field and studying for strong GRE stores, and fostering relationships with future advisors so that I would have the best possible chance (I assumed I had no chance of making it once he asked this question, but it turned out he was genuinely curious).

My essay talked about a lot how I want to work on increasing representation of minorities in academia and he asked if I was prepared for how emotionally taxing it would be if I ended up at a predominantly white institution (again, a question that threw me a bit at first). He also wanted to find out how I would  handle being in graduate programs that tend to have low retention rates for African-Americans and females. He asked about how I would deal with the culture shock of being an African-American in Asia and how I would feel if my experiences were different than that of my peers.

Overall, they were topics I felt comfortable talking about because I discuss them frequently with my mentors (Robert Benitez and Zakea Boeger). I focused on the fact that as a minority I have a unique responsibility and opportunity to represent myself and my culture to the best of my ability. I talked about working in Kiribati and in the Philippines in areas where people have often never seen African-Americans before but how I used these experiences as opportunities to represent diversity in America and lead by positive example.

I talked about using my platform in science and in academia to pave the way for students who come after me. I explained that I can’t control the way other people think but that I can make a positive impact by excelling in everything I do and being diplomatic in otherwise frustrating situations. I said that while I value my voice as a minority, I am more concerned with being remembered for my work as scientist and for making a small but concerted effort to make the world better. I mentioned that it can be frustrating working on field projects as the only female or minority but I understand I’m working to make things easier for other minorities and that regularly talking about these things with my mentors keeps me from becoming overwhelmed or isolated.

He asked about where I’d want to work if I got into the Luce program and I said that Cambodia and Vietnam were my first two choices. I also said that I was interested in the fellowship for the chance to grow as a leader and immerse myself in another culture to challenge the ways that I thought. I said that my placement didn’t have to be necessarily academic/archaeological in a nature. I was open to non-profit/community outreach work as well. I talked about how Southeast Asia and America have different ways of conceptualizing anthropology but that we have a lot to offer each other. I talked about how working with Luce would help me bridge this gap because it would help me to learn another way to think  and encourage more cross cultural connections in research.

When he asked if I had any questions I asked about past anthropologist in the program, he said they were assigned to a lot of community outreach type work. I closed by reiterating the fact that I shared the Luce values of leadership and excellence and innovation and that I was incredibly interested in working with this program.

I was worried I may have talked too fast at the beginning of the interview, but I made an effort to slow down and make sure my points were heard (we talked for a little over an hour). In preparation for the interview, I did a bunch of practice ones with my mentors to help get more comfortable before my actual interview and it really helped. In fact, I practiced the night before with one of my mentors over Skype to go over some of the questions I anticipated having to answer. Overall I felt confident afterwards.

The best advice I have is to be as open and honest as possible. It sounds corny but it’s honestly what got me through my interviews. Everyone who makes it to the interview round in Luce is pretty high achieving in some way or another. The best way to stand out is to let them get to know who you are as a person and as a leader and make them want to invest in that.

_**Henry Cheng, Luce Scholar**_  
For the interview, pretend you are having conversation with someone who knows you very well so you can be yourself, but still has a level of authority (such as a professor or a family member from an older generation) so you should still be more formal than relaxed in the interview.

Have list of examples where you can go into your experiences or qualities you have (eg. leadership, research, how you overcame adversity) and be ready to talk about them; you can often use these examples to answer a variety of questions. Make sure you don’t describe yourself in adjectives, have concrete examples and let committee decide for themselves the traits that you exhibit.

For the in-person interview, the committee is usually comprised of individuals who are accomplished in the Asian community (eg. Luce Scholars program alumni, Head of Asia Foundation, Executive Chair of another Asian agency, etc).

# Draft 2

Ask Tennesseans what makes the state great and you will hear country music or hot chicken. My answer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse created to research nuclear energy. As a student delegate in Japan, I presented the promise of molten salt reactors to a global audience that had lived through Fukushima. Colleagues from China, India, and Singapore asked about meltdowns, weaponization, and history. Sensitivity now metered my pride, as I championed safer advancements while honoring local experience. That symposium also opened three lasting threads in my life: a curiosity for Asia, a passion for sustainable innovation, and a Buddhist lens for service. Luce is where these threads intertwine.

Disruption and service have forged my journey to that goal. The coronavirus pandemic and my struggle with addiction prompted sudden withdrawal from university. As the grandchild of Latvian immigrants who suffered the same illness, I considered this possibility real but distant. I returned a year later with a new way of life involving 12-step recovery, vegetarianism, and leadership positions that kept me accountable to others. I staffed crisis lines, consulted writers, represented students in the senate, and spearheaded recovery research. The lesson was simple. Self-reliance can turn inward, and service keeps it pointed toward others. As evidenced by Luce Scholars, certain values become useful only in practice. 

I tested those values across languages and borders. Grants took me to Peru and Brazil, where Spanish and Portuguese turned strangers into teachers. Studying Peruvian indigenous communities contextualized myriad pathways to social impact, while speaking Spanish unlocked local conversations at recovery meetings on themes discussed in class. Honing similar abilities in Brazil, I bonded with my host mother about Spiritism, discovered Nipo-Brazilian history in Japantown, and read Buddhist scriptures in Portuguese on a meditation retreat. These extended cross-cultural dwellings were daunting though manageable compared to exploring another religion without understanding its language. Back home, I began a multi-month work exchange at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery that culminated in formal lay commitment and daily practice that persists years later. My embrace of these diverse perspectives did not afford privileged understanding but radical humility, symbolizing profound cultural oceans in which I had only waded. My later backpacking Southeast Asia reaffirmed that broad yet short exposure only provided so much. These Asian tangents would require submersion to deepen. Few options seemed available besides my ongoing independent engagements.

Professionally, my adolescence of nuclear energy, patent creation, and computer building blossomed into innovative inclinations. I led consulting projects for a startup to devise digital strategy and for Nissan to prototype a micro-mobility app. My tenure in venture capital entailed creating award-winning internal software while self-sourcing deals that turned into term sheets. Before graduation, I pioneered a National Science Foundation project for digitizing the maps, memorials, and markets of cemeteries. This innovative and intercultural momentum culminated in a Fulbright fellowship working in Mexico with Endeavor, where I interviewed founders of global companies and spearheaded entrepreneurial ecosystem research. I even sought opportunities beyond my placement like consulting for the Mexican government regarding a new airport. These leadership roles accelerated my impact, yet the back of my mind yearned for formal development to realize that extra mile.

My biggest initiative that year involved developing that scientific project into a startup called Kapala. The word symbolizes impermanence and occurs within both the Proto-Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan language branches. Like the etymology, I too strive to straddle distinct cultural contexts as a change-maker. To realize this ideal, I require formal leadership development, longterm Asian immersion, and first-hand experience. My forays into each area positions the Luce Scholars as the perfect catalyst, whether learning from lamas in Kathmandu, practicing Portuguese in Macau, or assisting startups in Singapore. The program offers the scaffolding I cannot assemble alone: a guided placement, language study, sector exposure, and an unparalleled cohort. I aim to grow from capable generalist to Asia-grounded operator leveraging a multinational, multilingual background. 

Many existing placements already align with my profile. The Thailand-based ChangeFusion would let me work at the intersection of incubation, impact investing, and community platforms. My contributions in product thinking and research discipline would complement systemic approaches to social enterprise. Ashoka India would deepen this entrepreneurial understanding as well, teaching me to scale impact across countries. I could even seek additional organizations untouched by Luce Scholars. The Nepalese Rangjung Yeshe Institute would allow me to apply my Tibetan language and Buddhist background in service of translation, digital resources, and community education. In Beijing, Innovation Hub Tec-China would let me build practical bridges between China, Mexico, and the United States by convening founders and investors across my networks. Alternatively, I could bring my early-stage, government-oriented startup experience to GovTech Singapore. My pragmatic, multicultural skillset prepares me for various placements even with adversity guaranteed. Besides such professional commitment, I would remain involved with local recovery and Buddhist organizations wherever possible. 

After Luce I would apply the learnings in stages from founder to facilitator to funder. I would continue my Buddhist studies program and startup business by leveraging experiential insights from Asia combined with those from Latin America. The formal leadership development would empower me to understand the academic context and lead my company into later stages. I would then pursue Asia-oriented graduate studies like the Lauder MBA/MA to keep building Luce year language competencies. That foundation would enable me to move into a platform role supporting the international innovation ecosystem, bolstered by local networks and global peers from the Luce. I would ultimately aim to give back by supporting global founders as an angel investor and  mentor. Such investment encourages intercultural communication from visiting the other side, establishing a foothold, and developing mutually understandable ways of interacting.

Perspective has taught me to contextualize. Innovation has moved me to act. Buddhism has implored me to serve. Luce is perfect for people like me to mobilize these tendencies alongside peers who challenge and guide. The program would tie those three threads into a unified cord pulling me into a future that seemed distant until now.

# Draft 1.5 (ChatGPT feedback incorporation)

Ask Tennesseans what makes the state great and you will hear country music or hot chicken. My answer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse created to research nuclear energy. As a student delegate in Japan, I presented the promise of molten salt reactors to a global audience that had lived through Fukushima. Colleagues from China, India, and Singapore asked about meltdowns, weaponization, and history. I learned to argue for safer technology while honoring local experience. That week also opened two lasting threads in my life, a curiosity for Asia and a Buddhist lens for service. Luce is where these threads become a practitioner’s path.

I have built cross-cultural and technical muscles in the United States and Mexico, yet I lack structured mentorship and immersion in Asia. Luce provides a mentored placement, language learning, and sector exposure that I cannot assemble on my own. I want to contribute as an operator who ships useful tools, and I need Luce to accelerate that shift from capable generalist to Asia-grounded practitioner.

My journey to that goal was forged through disruption and service. During the pandemic I withdrew from university to recover from addiction. I returned a year later with different habits and priorities, including vegetarianism, Buddhist practice, and service positions that kept me accountable to others. I staffed crisis lines, consulted writers, represented students in the senate, and spearheaded research on collegiate recovery. The lesson was simple. Self-reliance can turn inward, and service keeps it pointed toward others. Luce fits because it rewards values that become useful only in practice.

I then tested those values across languages and borders. Grants took me to Peru and Brazil, where Spanish and Portuguese turned strangers into teachers. In Brazil I learned Portuguese in homestays, joined recovery meetings, and compared Spiritism and Buddhism with my host mother over dinner. Back home, a work exchange at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery led to formal lay commitment and daily practice. These experiences did not make me a scholar of religion, they made me a better teammate who can listen across difference. Luce will let me keep learning by contributing on the ground in Buddhist-influenced contexts.

Professionally, I moved from analysis to building. I prototyped a micromobility app for a multinational, then joined a venture firm to research companies and ship internal tooling. Before graduation I stood up a small National Science Foundation project and later co-founded Kapala, a platform that digitizes cemeteries so families can find and honor their dead. The product combines mapping, data, and human-centered design. While on a Fulbright in Mexico with Endeavor, I interviewed founders and led ecosystem research that informed public and private partners. Those months taught me to work in another country’s cadence, in another language, with executive stakeholders who needed decisions framed, not just data summarized. Luce will build on that binational training by placing me inside an Asian organization where real users and peers depend on my output.

Recovery and Fulbright taught me the value of lived experience. Luce directly closes my development gap. I need structured mentorship in leadership, social impact, and venture at Asian institutions that translate ideas into delivery. Luce already offers several past placements aligned with my profile. In Thailand, ChangeFusion would let me work at the intersection of incubation, impact investing, and community platforms. I would learn system-change approaches to social enterprise while contributing product thinking and research discipline. Ashoka India would deepen my practitioner network in social entrepreneurship. I would learn how to scale impact through fellow support and youth pipelines while contributing lightweight tools and evidence synthesis for fellows and partners. Organizations 

The Nepalese Rangjung Yeshe Institute would allow me to apply my Tibetan language training in service of translation, digital resources, and community education. I would learn preservation workflows and partner etiquette and I would add geospatial and product skills to help make texts and teachings more accessible. In Beijing, the Innovation Hub Tec-China would let me build practical bridges between China, Mexico, and the United States by convening founders and investors across my networks. I would learn cross-border commercialization dynamics and contribute binational market navigation for teams entering the Americas. In Singapore, GovTech would let me bring early-stage startup experience to public service delivery. I would learn service design at national scale and agile collaboration with regulators while contributing shipped product experience, disciplined user research, and clear writing for technical and nontechnical audiences.

I measure progress by what I ship and who it serves. During Luce I aim to deliver three outcomes with my host. First, a shipped product or process improvement with documented user impact. Second, a short public brief that maps useful bridges between Asian and Americas startup ecosystems in my host’s domain. Third, a small open dataset or toolkit that outlives my fellowship. These deliverables keep me honest about value creation, and Luce’s structured mentorship will keep me accountable for quality.

After Luce I will apply what I learned in two stages. First, I will continue building Kapala with contributions from Asia and Latin America, incorporating local cultural practices and government workflows. Second, I will move into a platform role that supports founders at the intersection of civic needs and sustainable business, with a focus on people in recovery. Over time I plan to back founders who build quietly useful things. Luce is the catalyst that turns conviction into capability in Asia.

The throughline across my path is consistent. International perspective taught me to contextualize innovation. A Buddhist lens keeps me accountable to the people affected by my work. A practitioner mindset moves me from analysis to delivery. Luce is built for people like me to become more useful, faster, alongside peers who will challenge and guide me. I will bring to the cohort a binational foundation, product discipline, beginner’s humility in Asia, and a bias for building. With Luce’s placement, mentorship, and regional immersion, I will become the kind of operator who helps institutions deliver with care.

# Draft 1

Ask Tennesseans what makes their state so great, and you get answers like country music, hot chicken, or southern hospitality. My go-to answer is the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the innovation powerhouse first established to research nuclear energy. Sensitivity now metered my pride as I presented the benefits of molten salt reactors in Japan, a country devastated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdown just years prior. As one of two delegates representing the United States to a global audience, my conduct reflected my country. What about meltdowns? Weaponization? Historical baggage? asked representatives from China, India, Singapore, and more. It was rewarding to champion safer advancements but more so to contextualize my perspective. Besides sustainable innovation, the symposium catalyzed my intrigue for vegetarianism, Buddhism, and Asia more broadly. The former two contrasted with my bible-belt barbecue upbringing, though a panel on animal products and a monk on alms round impressed me deeply.

College was bound to amplify this development until macro- and micro-level black swan events shifted the course. The coronavirus pandemic and my struggle with addiction prompted sudden withdrawal from university. My shutdown coincided with that of the world. As the grandchild of Latvian immigrants who suffered the same illness, I considered this possibility real but distant. Suddenly I found my walls colorless and shoes laceless. Healing required not only medical intervention but creative destruction. I replaced substance-use with abstinence, meat-eating with vegetarianism, and agnosticism with Buddhism. The former especially changed my life because working a 12-step program taught me how self-reliance can conduce to self-destruction. Focusing on others was paramount to long-term recovery; I accepted service positions like secretary or meeting chair within a nearby group. This radical transformation also permitted re-entering university one year later.

My spirit emerged from its shell like faces from their masks. I began with stability to ease my return, dedicating an undergraduate major to Spanish in continuation of my adolescent aptitude from a summer in Spain. On-campus activities blossomed into leadership opportunities; previous hardships fueled present service. I became a student government senator to represent my language immersion dormitory, served as a board member for the association that oversees all collegiate recovery programs because of my involvement, and spearheaded cross-cultural addiction research after demonstrated academic performance. I concurrently worked as a writing consultant and crisis counselor to serve others at an individual level. Though not essential for service, a representative, researcher, or counselor with lived experience such as myself could comprehend subtleties like code switching. These engagements all demonstrated that my past did not prohibit but redefined success. Such resilience permeated my internal world even amidst rapid external changes.

This assimilation laid the foundation for growth off campus. Recovery and re-integration filled every waking second, yet I yearned to develop those curiosities ignited in Japan. Such impulse brought me to a domestic Tibetan Buddhist monastery for its work exchange program. Entering another culture with so little experience was daunting, let alone another religion. Compassion is fortunately central in this case; the monastic residents offered hospitality rivaling even the most generous southerner. Weeks of volunteer work soon intertwined with intense teachings alongside veteran practitioners, resulting in "taking refuge" under the abbot---committing to Buddhist living. Thus began my daily study and practice that persists years later, whether via scripture recitations, group meditations, or extended retreats. This spiritual calling brought dreams of experiencing Buddhist cultures, but academic pursuits pulled me elsewhere.

My inward odyssey mirrored outward exploration. Spanish and Portuguese literature filled my shelves concomitant with multiple language grants and programs in Peru and Brazil. Traveling abroad carried not only educational but personal significance, as I had not done so since beginning recovery. Studying Peruvian indigenous communities offered parallels to both Tibet and Brazil, as my class discussed diverse pathways to empowerment at the intersection of modernity and tradition. Moreover, speaking Spanish enabled attending recovery meetings and conversing with locals regarding nuanced questions like assimilation and autonomy. I sought the same ability in Brazil, so I dove into Portuguese study. Before long, I was bonding with my Brazilian host mother about Spiritism, discovering Nipo-Brazilian history in Japantown, and reading Buddhist scriptures in Portuguese on a meditation retreat. I grew this curiosity on return through efforts like formal independent study.

Such drive for new ideas complemented my innovative inclinations born from creating a patent and building computers in high school. I honed this interest in college through professional opportunities, like building a prototype micro-mobility mobile app for Nissan during a summer stint in consulting. I enjoyed leading this process so much that I also created customer management software for my next job at a venture capital firm, all the while sourcing deals that turned into term sheets. This creative impulse carried over to personal projects, as I-Corps funding enabled developing a startup idea before graduation. Reconnecting with my prior yearning, I backpacked Southeast Asia that summer, where the broad yet short exposure left me eager for more.

This innovative and intercultural momentum culminated in a Fulbright fellowship working in Mexico with Endeavor, where I interviewed founders of global companies and spearheaded entrepreneurial ecosystem research. I sought opportunities beyond work like a consulting for the Mexican government regarding a new airport. I also invested considerable time coding for that startup idea an application to digitize cemeteries, named Kapala after the Buddhist term signifying impermanence. Following my time in Mexico, we landed our first customer, and I received a scholarship for the three-year Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy program beginning this fall.

Despite studying and undertaking leadership, I lack a formal development program to magnify my abilities like I-Corps did for Kapala. The Luce offers this foundation and Asian immersion needed for my aspirations, whether learning from lamas in Kathmandu, practicing Portuguese in Macau, or assisting startups in Singapore. My multinational, multilingual background would regardless foster multipolar understanding. I will use the experience to bridge U.S., Latin American, and Asian startup ecosystems as a business leader before becoming a funder supporting founders in recovery. I will also ordain as a lay-monastic intermediary to spread Buddhist teachings.

- Business (including social enterprise)

**1000 characters**

My adolescence of patent development and time abroad ignited passion for innovative and intercultural affairs. To deepen this drive, I studied organizational development and languages at university. My professional experience began with consulting for a local startup on market strategy and a Japanese corporation on app development. Serving, researching, and governing organizations that address social issues shifted my emphasis to impact innovation. I stayed involved with the ecosystem by analyzing startups at a globally focused venture capital firm. These experiences culminated in a role leading entrepreneurial research for Endeavor Mexico. Though supporting ecosystems was rewarding, I felt called to launch a venture after testing the idea through Innovation Corps. I currently lead Kapala, a business providing digital maps, memorials, and markets for cemeteries. I intend to scale, become a founder-turned-funder, and bridge the U.S., Latin American, and Asian entrepreneurial ecosystems.

# Question 1: Leadership

Leadership is not titular but demonstrative: aligning one's thoughts, words, and deeds to become maximally beneficial to others. I consider Thich Nhat Hanh to epitomize this ideal through his "engaged Buddhism." Sitting in meditation during wartime, the Vietnamese Zen master exemplified practical compassion by leaving the monastery to organize peaceful activism, accepting exile when refusing to take sides. He managed in such condition to build the global monastic community Plum Village that promotes wellbeing through mindfulness and interdependence. Even unable to speak later in life, he continued to lead with presence, embodying the idea that “our life is our message.”

Nhat Hanh modeled a transformative vision that empowered others, which my adolescent self first discovered by reading his books during a time of grief and illness. When purely individual effort proved fallible, recovery and Buddhism made engaging others foremost, whether through mindful communication as a crisis counselor or human-centered design as a software developer. Spiritual theory grounded such practices. I have also sought to perpetuate service beyond my presence by shaping non-profit and startup organizations. Foreign environments do not dampen but differentiate my impact, as I adapted to cultural limitations and nuances abroad.

Personifying an iota of Nhat Hanh would represent a tremendous feat. I nonetheless aspire to blend inner discipline and outward service: be calm under pressure, communicate with care, take thoughtful risks, and measure leadership by whether people around me become more capable and compassionate. That is the leadership I practice and intend to deepen.

# Question 2: Team Dynamics

"Too much information" quipped the managing director in Spanish alongside a barrage of critiques. As his sounds lost their semantics, my anxiety-driven tachycardia prompted reflection on the precarious past weeks. The organization had reassigned me to lead the biannual venture capital study. The butterflies in my stomach started to feel more like bats, as I stepped into a role recently vacated by a beloved leader who had directed every prior version. My cross-functional, hybrid collaborators across Data, Research, and Marketing looked at me with anticipation. 

This situation mirrored my teamwork tendencies, as I prefer to support but lead if called. My penchant for guiding roles, like crisis counselor and writing consultant, established this inclination. However, the best leaders are those who simultaneously support, as illustrated by Thich Nhat Hanh. Idealism aside, my biggest weakness stems from acting alone. I must ask for help before momentum hardens into isolation.

This myopia tainted the initial draft denounced by the managing director. Lacking native speech proved humbling, so I prioritized listening to feedback throughout dialogues with each department. I also played to my strengths like polite written communication to avoid Mexican workplace taboos of direct, informal requests. These adaptations did not discredit my self-confidence; I drew from my venture capital experience to tailor findings to an investor audience, navigating political subtleties like which firms to highlight. The end product with its myriad changes resembled the Ship of Theseus. Yet, the collective resilience and adaptation ultimately delivered the most successful study of the year. 

# Question 3: Luce Impact

My intrigue for Asia is longstanding yet transient. Because my professional and academic trajectory necessitated specialization in the Americas, I sought independent means to connect with Asia. Reading D.T. Suzuki and Osamu Dazai encouraged me to represent the United States at Japanese sustainability symposium with students from across Asia. That event later augmented consulting for a Japanese manufacturer and studying Nipo-Brazilian history. Yet, the strongest connections were personal. Exposure to a jade Budai statue left my childhood self asking my parents about the joyful chubby man. I later spent years engaging with Mahayana Buddhism and Tibetan culture. This independent commitment has extended throughout a summer backpacking Southeast Asia and into a multiyear Buddhist studies program.

These experiences have proven enriching yet lacked long-term immersion. Given fellowships like Fulbright, I recognize the metamorphic potential exclusive to integrating within a country for extended periods. My career trajectory continues to present deeper leadership opportunities yet no formal development program. It is therefore the ideal time to consummate that leadership potential and Asia enthusiasm as a Luce Scholar. I would thrive at various placements like Ashoka India, ChangeFusion Thailand, or elsewhere beyond my niche. I would connect with local Buddhist and recovery groups while pursuing community projects like in Mexico. The momentum would enhance my startup leadership, complement my Buddhist studies, and foster the lingual-cultural skills for an Asia-oriented graduate program like the Lauder MBA/MA. The triregional expertise from the Luce would position me to translate ideas, capital, and practice across ecosystems.---

Growing up in Nashville has afforded me many special places throughout my lifetime. I am sitting in one of the most fascinating, John B Garrett Lodge #711. For those unfamiliar with the world's largest fraternal organization, Freemasonry promotes universal co by inward virtue and outward service. What looks like an unassuming interior in fact houses generations of community involvement extending even to the founding fathers. I passed many such lodges while growing up, completely unaware, until I knocked on its doors at the end of college.

Despite the geographic proximity, it could not have felt more foreign. I was the youngest  by decades and surrounded by indecipherable symbols.
