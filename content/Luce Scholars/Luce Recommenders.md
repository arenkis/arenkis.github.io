Two letters of recommendation (LORs) are required - **with a** **MAXIMUM
of one academic letter and AT LEAST one professional letter. **

-   **Academic LORs** may come from professors, mentors, advisors, or
    others who have directly supervised your academic work or research.

-   **Professional LORs** should come from a supervisor with whom you’ve
    worked closely over a significant time and who can speak to your
    work ethic, leadership potential, and impact. This may include
    summer internships, provided the supervisor had ample time to
    observe your work.

For each recommender, you must complete a form using their name and
email address. Once submitted, the recommender will receive an email
with instructions for writing and uploading the LOR directly to the
application portal. **Letters must be uploaded separately by the
recommenders.** 

We encourage you to seek recommenders who know you well and have
**directly observed your work**—whether in academic, professional, or
leadership settings. They should be able to speak to your **skills,
achievements, and leadership potential.** Recommenders should also be
familiar with your personal strengths and future promise. All LORs must
be **signed and on official letterhead.  
 **  
**Deadline:** Letters must be uploaded by **5:00 PM EST on September
15.**

We strongly encourage you to request your letters as early as possible.
You may jump to the "**Request Recommendation Letters**" task at any
time while completing your application. Applications will be considered
**incomplete** if both LORs are not submitted by the deadline.
