# Question 1: Leadership

## Draft 2

Leadership means translating vision to impact by meeting people where they are. I most admire exemplar Thich Nhat Hanh for his "engaged Buddhism." The Vietnamese Thiền master left retreat during wartime to organize peaceful activism, established monastic communities while in exile, and still practiced mindful communication throughout.

His mighty principles characterized my miniature entrepreneurial journey. When my friend searched rows of headstones for his great-grandfather's grave to no avail, I sensed a cultural gap around death and memory. Solving this problem required personal initiative. However, initial hardware-based prototypes failed. Customer interviews revealed tough truths: elderly individuals avoided discussing their own deaths, and mortuary professionals resisted managing physical products. Rather than retreat, I actively listened to feedback that pivoted our product to pure software.

The startup also transformed from my working in Mexico as a Fulbright Scholar. Witnessing Day of the Dead celebrations, where families reconnected with ancestors amid marigolds and sweet bread, shifted emphasis from individual to community legacies. Like Nhat Hanh, we recognized this interdependence as crucial for sustainable development. This collective focus led to partnerships with cemeteries including Nashville City Cemetery and multiple investment offers.

Nhat Hanh ultimately demonstrated that true leadership creates conditions for others to flourish. My variant involves empowering future generations to connect with their heritage. Such entrepreneurial tendency has prepared me to spot overlooked needs and integrate culturally-attuned solutions. The Luce will refine my leadership in the same region as my hero, transforming cultural boundaries into bridges between technological innovation and ancestral wisdom.

## Draft 1

Leadership is not titular but demonstrative: aligning one's thoughts, words, and deeds to become maximally beneficial to others. I consider Thich Nhat Hanh to epitomize this ideal through his "engaged Buddhism." Sitting in meditation during wartime, the Vietnamese Zen master exemplified practical compassion by leaving the monastery to organize peaceful activism, accepting exile when refusing to take sides. He managed in such condition to build the global monastic community Plum Village that promotes wellbeing through mindfulness and interdependence. Even unable to speak later in life, he continued to lead with presence, embodying the idea that “our life is our message.”

Nhat Hanh modeled a transformative vision that empowered others, which my adolescent self first discovered by reading his books during a time of grief and illness. When purely individual effort proved fallible, recovery and Buddhism made engaging others foremost, whether through mindful communication as a crisis counselor or human-centered design as a software developer. Spiritual theory grounded such practices. I have also sought to perpetuate service beyond my presence by shaping non-profit and startup organizations. Foreign environments do not dampen but differentiate my impact, as I adapted to cultural limitations and nuances abroad.

Personifying an iota of Nhat Hanh would represent a tremendous feat. I nonetheless aspire to blend inner discipline and outward service: be calm under pressure, communicate with care, take thoughtful risks, and measure leadership by whether people around me become more capable and compassionate. That is the leadership I practice and intend to deepen.

# Question 2: Team Dynamics

## Draft 2

“Too much information” quipped the managing director in Spanish alongside a barrage of critiques. The organization had reassigned me, the department's only non-Mexican national, to lead the biannual venture capital study in my second language after the previous director's sudden departure. This situation meant managing three departments with competing priorities while navigating Mexican workplace hierarchies as an outsider. My hybrid collaborators across Data, Research, and Marketing looked at me with anticipation.

While I typically prefer supporting roles, this leadership challenge exposed my tendency to work in isolation, a weakness that failed the first draft. Working across Mexican workplace hierarchies required cultural adaptation; connecting outside formal contexts built the trust essential for professional collaboration. Since Data lacked a department head, I acted as substitute director while coordinating with the project lead. My American directness shifted to polite WhatsApp messages, discovering the cultural need to “echar flores” or pay compliments. When Marketing pushed for client prominence while Research demanded objectivity, I negotiated compromises.

These adaptations leveraged rather than undermined my expertise. I drew from venture capital experience to tailor findings for investors while having local colleagues review Spanish documents before executive presentations. The end product resembled the Ship of Theseus. Yet, this collective adaptation delivered the year's most successful study: 830 million person reach with $2 million advertising value across top outlets like Reuters, Bloomberg, and Forbes. Such experience directly prepares me for Luce placements requiring navigation of foreign bureaucracies, stakeholder management in non-native languages, and cultural fluency without sacrificing professional standards.

## Draft 1

"Too much information" quipped the managing director in Spanish alongside a barrage of critiques. As his sounds lost their semantics, my anxiety-driven tachycardia prompted reflection on the precarious past weeks. The organization had reassigned me to lead the biannual venture capital study. The butterflies in my stomach started to feel more like bats, as I stepped into a role recently vacated by a beloved leader who had directed every prior version. My cross-functional, hybrid collaborators across Data, Research, and Marketing looked at me with anticipation. 

This situation mirrored my teamwork tendencies, as I prefer to support but lead if called. My penchant for guiding roles, like crisis counselor and writing consultant, established this inclination. However, the best leaders are those who simultaneously support, as illustrated by Thich Nhat Hanh. Idealism aside, my biggest weakness stems from acting alone. I must ask for help before momentum hardens into isolation.

This myopia tainted the initial draft denounced by the managing director. Lacking native speech proved humbling, so I prioritized listening to feedback throughout dialogues with each department. I also played to my strengths like polite written communication to avoid Mexican workplace taboos of direct, informal requests. These adaptations did not discredit my self-confidence; I drew from my venture capital experience to tailor findings to an investor audience, navigating political subtleties like which firms to highlight. The end product with its myriad changes resembled the Ship of Theseus. Yet, the collective resilience and adaptation ultimately delivered the most successful study of the year. 

# Question 3: Luce Impact

My intrigue for Asia is longstanding yet transient. Because my professional and academic trajectory necessitated specialization in the Americas, I sought independent means to connect with Asia. Reading D.T. Suzuki and Osamu Dazai encouraged me to represent the United States at Japanese sustainability symposium with students from across Asia. That event later augmented consulting for a Japanese manufacturer and studying Nipo-Brazilian history. Yet, the strongest connections were personal. Exposure to a jade Budai statue left my childhood self asking my parents about the joyful chubby man. I later spent years engaging with Mahayana Buddhism and Tibetan culture. This independent commitment has extended throughout a summer backpacking Southeast Asia and into a multiyear Buddhist studies program.

These experiences have proven enriching yet lacked long-term immersion. Given fellowships like Fulbright, I recognize the metamorphic potential exclusive to integrating within a country for extended periods. My career trajectory continues to present deeper leadership opportunities yet no formal development program. It is therefore the ideal time to consummate that leadership potential and Asia enthusiasm as a Luce Scholar. I would thrive at various placements like Ashoka India, ChangeFusion Thailand, or elsewhere beyond my niche. I would connect with local Buddhist and recovery groups while pursuing community projects like in Mexico. The momentum would enhance my startup leadership, complement my Buddhist studies, and foster the lingual-cultural skills for an Asia-oriented graduate program like the Lauder MBA/MA. The triregional expertise from the Luce would position me to translate ideas, capital, and practice across ecosystems.
