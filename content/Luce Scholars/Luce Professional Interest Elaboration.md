- Business (including social enterprise)

**1000 characters**

My adolescence of patent development and time abroad ignited passion for innovative and intercultural affairs. To deepen this drive, I studied organizational development and languages at university. My professional experience began with consulting for a local startup on market strategy and a Japanese corporation on app development. Serving, researching, and governing organizations that address social issues shifted my emphasis to impact innovation. I stayed involved with the ecosystem by analyzing startups at a globally focused venture capital firm. These experiences culminated in a role leading entrepreneurial research for Endeavor Mexico. Though supporting ecosystems was rewarding, I felt called to launch a venture after testing the idea through Innovation Corps. I currently lead Kapala, a business providing digital maps, memorials, and markets for cemeteries. Technology and tradition intersect in Asia. I intend to rekindle societal engagement with death from intercultural insights.
