# Detailed Summary

- Statement of purpose lacks academic program specifics despite strong China focus
    - Makes compelling case for Beijing cultural immersion and networking opportunities
    - Missing emphasis on Schwarzman’s unique academic elements:
        - Coursework structure and faculty mentorship
        - Classmate interactions and collaborative projects
        - One-year master’s in global affairs program specifics
- Core application question: “Why Schwarzman vs. other China opportunities?”
    - Need to articulate what program offers beyond location
    - Distinguish from working at firm that sends you to Beijing
    - Address why you need this specific academic structure
- Essay currently reads more like general China interest than academic program application
- Feedback on balancing program praise:
    - Avoid generic statements about Schwarzman prestige
    - Focus on unique program aspects that align with personal goals
    - Don’t waste sentences on obvious competitiveness

### Disciplinary Action Response Strategy

- Current draft too detailed about mental health/recovery background
    - Includes specific diagnoses and recovery terminology
    - Recommended simplified approach: “took medical leave of absence”
- Cultural context considerations critical:
    - China has higher mental health stigma than US academic environments
    - Schwarzman more business-oriented than humanitarian/social science programs
    - Corporate mindset may have different tolerance levels
- Risk mitigation approach:
    - Mention strong academic return (maintained 4.0 GPA post-leave)
    - Expand on successful student performance after return
    - Keep explanatory section minimal or blank
- Cautionary precedent shared:
    - Friend accepted to NALCAP, disclosed recovery status for support needs
    - Program rescinded offer, citing “serious program” concerns
    - Highlights importance of strategic disclosure timing
        
### Video Application Requirements and Strategy

- Luce video strict technical limitations:
    - Absolutely no green screens, video splicing, or professional editing
    - Multiple takes allowed, but must be single continuous shot
    - Policy designed to prevent advantages from videography skills
    - Can move camera and adjust background setup
- Content approach for Luce:
    - Show aspects not fully covered in written application
    - Can expand on briefly mentioned topics if space was limited
    - More casual, authentic presentation style acceptable
    - Monastery/Buddhist practice filming could work well
- Schwarzman video more flexible:
    - Fewer explicit technical restrictions
    - Focus on “place that best conveys you as Schwarzman applicant”
    - Shorter duration than Luce video
    - Should reflect more academic/business-minded persona
- Filming location strategic considerations:
    - Buddhist temple viable for both (local Nashville temple suggested)
    - Avoid Tibet references entirely for Schwarzman application
    - Could showcase business/entrepreneurial elements instead
    - Nashville heritage locations as alternatives
    - Masonic connections problematic given China restrictions

### Application Risk Assessment

- Multiple identity elements potentially problematic for China-focused program:
    - Mental health history (discussed above)
    - Tibetan Buddhism connections (politically sensitive)
    - Masonic membership (banned in China, exists only in diaspora)
- Strategic navigation required:
    - Buddhism generally acceptable in Chinese cultural context
    - “Tibet” terminology absolute red flag for Schwarzman
    - Masonic involvement advisor admits unfamiliarity, requires independent research
- Balance between authentic self-presentation and program compatibility
- Similar conversations happening with current Fulbright applicants
- Goal: present most fundable aspects while remaining authentic
    

### Administrative and Process Updates

- September calendar availability:
    - Advisor lifting month-long calendar hold immediately
    - Fulbright committee work completed, opening schedule
    - Future appointments should show availability within hours
- Communication logistics:
    - Vanderbilt discontinued alumni email access
    - Issue not VU-IT’s decision (higher administration choice)
    - VU-IT handling upset alumni/student fallout unfairly
    - Use personal email for future correspondence
- Meeting preparation request:
    - Send specific questions/focus areas 2 days before next meeting
    - Similar to email format that guided current productive conversation
    - Helps advisor prepare targeted feedback on drafts
        

### Next Steps

- Alex: Revise Schwarzman essay emphasizing academic program specifics
- Alex: Write video scripts incorporating sensitivity guidelines
- Alex: Complete Luce short answer revisions (postponed for essay priority)
- Alex: Research Masonic involvement implications independently
- Future meeting: Final review session with well-prepared materials and question list

# Meeting Notes

- Biggest thematic question, schwarzman statement of grant purpose
	- Not building the case for Schwarzman specifically
	- Not easy for young american professionals to spend a year in beijing
	- strongest application
	- when you are on schwarzman's website,
	- when you are talking to people who have experienced schwarzman
	- what do i want to learn from that
	- less familiar with schwarzman vs fulbright eta
	- good case for being in beijing, the culture, the connections
	- what you are lacking 
	- there is a coursework aspect of that, classmates, mentors, projects, what would you get out
	- would not assume you were applying to an academic program
- very strong for being in beijing, studying in beijng, think about why this is the right program, most excited about schwarzman, help make it more specific, hit on beijing, university, what is schwarzman
- walking the line between buttering it up, versus what makes it so competitive, how it is so unique, that is the line you're trying to, make 
- one aspect of schwarzman application, disciplinary action
	- we are very fortunate
	- in the contexts, 
	- can talk about medical and mental health experiences
	- not going to be pushback
	- there is not necessarily the same outlook in the world in which schwarzman exists, there is a little more stigma
	- schwarzman is an academic scholarship, but it is not necessarily humanitarian or social science academic structure. it is very much more business minded academic structure, different levels of stigma in corporate versus humanitarian
	- given context, i would not want anyone to mark it as a 
	- all you have to say is that you took a medical leave of absence, you could say mental health leave of absence
	- advise to take a less is more approach here, not because it is poor fit, do not want to end initial review f
	- it makes sense to talk about how strong you returned, very capable, suggests that is did not negatively impact your experience afterwards
	- shortening to saying you withdrew, took a medical leave of absence, expand on how you were able to exists as a successful and healthy student, you can, going into detail about specific diagnoses, raise flags for someone less familiar
- specific luce video details
	- they are specifically hoping to learn something about you that does not show up in other parts of your application; does not have to be out of the complete blue
	- makes sense for your luce video, students in the past have their extracurriculars, similar to what they are applying to do, but they do not get to expand on that in a meaningful way, taken at their internship site, ancestry in a certain part of the world, want to apply 
	- nothing you said, but needs to be mentioned, do not allow any sort of high tech anything, no splicing the video, they specifically felt like it was not enough to say we will not award, no advantage from professional videography anything, did not want to hurt students who do not have a specific skillset
	- straight take video, adjust your background, move your camera, keep that in mind, needs to be low tech
	- schwarzman, not as much detail as what they do not allow, keep in mind that any sort of 
	- anything that distracts of getting to know you , luce will not have any issue with that, thinking about how could you discuss further that you would want luce to know, but you would not be able to fit into the application
	- be very careful with schwarzman, careful with how you approach tibetan buddhism, it is likely going to be less open than the luce review board, as far as how you talk about tibetan buddhism, you need to take the conversation you had last time, and apply it to the video as well
	- luce video more casual than schwarzman video, values that authenticity of video
	- schwarzman has
	- not what they are going to be grading you on
	- if you wanted to play within schwarzman, they will not take points away from you for doing that
	- they want to know who you are outside of the written part
	- 

# Pre Meeting Notes
- Schwarzman Statement of Purpose Review
	- It connects to my broader U.S.-Mexico-China vision and the value of 1 year in Beijing
- Schwarzman Leadership Essay Review
	- It is a longitudinal profile of starting a startup, going from idea to first customers
- Schwarzman Leadership Resume / CV Review
- Schwarzman Clarification Comment and Disciplinary Action
	- Mine overlap because my clarification involves withdrawing from school which triggers the "yes" category for disciplinary action, although I never faced any disciplinary issues. I withdrew of my own accord to seek treatment.
	- How should I handle these two distinct sections?
- Luce Personal Statement Rewrite Review
- Luce and Schwarzman Video Questions
	- I will be at a monastery to take Tibetan lessons starting on September 9th. Would it be a good idea to film the video(s) there? It is a special place for me. 
		- Update: probably not the best to include within the Schwarzman
	- The Luce video asks for something that does not appear anywhere else in my application; my connection to Buddhism does
	- Schwarzman is just a video that best conveys your interests or personality
- Successful Vanderbilt Alumni
	- How did they go about crafting their applications?
