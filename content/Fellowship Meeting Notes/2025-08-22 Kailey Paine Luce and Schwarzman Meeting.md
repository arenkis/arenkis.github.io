# Kailey Raw Notes

## Luce

Personal Statement

- This is beautifully written, and I agree that the story you tell has an important place in describing how you’ve become the person you are, but it does very little to persuade me that Luce is the most logical next step for you.

Short Answers

- Leadership
	- More focused nonconcrete, narrative examples the example, less on the intangible aspects.
- Team Dynamics
	- This seems like it could be a good example, but I’m getting a bit lost in your prose, and I can’t clearly understand the challenge and how you demonstrated leadership and/or teamwork to overcome it

## Schwartzman

Statement of Purpose

- Same as Luce, as of now, this gives me no information about why Schwarzman is the right fit for you, and that’s supposed to be the main point of this essay.

Short Answers 2

- Consider taking this in a direction that is more specific, unique to you, and also ties more directly to your reason for applying for Schwatzman

Bio

- “such as the World Bank and Mexican Government”

Leadership Roles

- Great examples! I suggest you include the month(s), year(s) for each as you would on a resume
# Action Items

### Master framing

-  Set a rule: **≥50% of each personal statement = why the program (fit + mutual value)**
-  Define a single throughline (international perspective + Buddhist lens + practitioner mindset) and weave it across all essays.
-  Create a one-page **placements matrix** (3–5 orgs per program: target role, what you’ll learn, what you add).
### Luce Personal Statement (≤1,000 words)

-  Keep the engaging origin paragraph, but reach **“why Luce” by paragraph 2**.
-  **Condense personal narrative to ≤40–50%**; cut vignettes that don’t serve “why Luce.”
-  Expand the **formal-development gap** and how Luce specifically closes it (mentorship, sector exposure, Asia focus).
-  Name **3–5 specific placements** and explain **why each matters** to your trajectory.
-  **Foreground Buddhist engagement** with plausible Luce locations/orgs; tie to leadership growth.
-  Emphasize **practitioner outcomes** (deliverables, skills, networks) → clear **post-Luce plan**.
### Luce Short Answer — Team Dynamics (≈250 words)

-  State the **challenge in one sentence** (who/what/where/why it was hard).
-  Show **your actions** (steps, decisions, tradeoffs) over emotions.
-  Highlight **cross-cultural + second-language navigation** as the differentiator.
-  Specify the **result** (changes, measurable outcomes if possible).
-  Close with **how this prepares you for Luce placements**.
### Luce Short Answer — Leadership

-  Trim theory to **1–2 sentences** (values origin), then move to a **concrete narrative**.
-  Pick **one crisp story** (yours or observing another) that shows leadership in practice.
-  Make the link to **Luce’s hands-on nature** explicit (what you’ll do on the ground).

### Schwarzman Statement of Purpose

-  Use the same arc: **origin → tie threads → why Schwarzman (≥50%)**.
-  Map **program features** (Beijing base, field studies, network) to your US–MX–CN goals.
-  Calibrate the **Buddhist thread**: cultural-underpinnings lens, not advocacy.
-  Specify **where/how in China** you’d engage (regions, topics, field trips) and what you’d study/do.
-  End with a concrete **post-Schwarzman plan** and your **unique cohort value**.

### Schwarzman Short Answers (write last)

-  After main essays, list **what’s missing** that reviewers must know.
-  Choose **one truly distinctive differentiator** that **also** ties to Schwarzman’s mission.
-  Replace items that are interesting but **not strategically essential**.
    

### Buddhist Integration (both applications)

-  **Luce**: foreground as a coherent learning arc + relevant placements.
-  **Schwarzman**: careful terminology; frame as cultural/ethical inquiry and leadership development.
-  Incorporate pending **advisor/Dr. Lambert** phrasing guidance on Tibet/Tibetan Buddhism.
    

### Style & substance (all essays)

-  Cut ornamental prose; favor **actions, decisions, outcomes**.
-  End each paragraph with a line that **ties back to “why this program.”**
-  **Quantify impact** where possible (numbers, scope, stakeholders).
-  Verify **word limits** and **program-first ratio** before polishing.

### Supporting materials & alignment

-  Build the **placements matrix** and keep references consistent across essays.
-  Align **resume/bio** with the practitioner arc highlighted in essays.
-  Brief recommenders on your **program-fit thesis** so letters echo your case.
### Process plan
-  Draft **Luce PS v2** with ≥50% program focus.
-  Rewrite **Luce Team Dynamics** and **Leadership** with concrete narratives.
-  Draft **Schwarzman SOP v2** mirroring the program-first structure.
-  Write **Schwarzman short answers** only after identifying true gaps.
-  Final pass: ensure **thread consistency** and avoid duplicated content across essays.
# Large Summary Notes

### Luce Personal Statement - Complete Structural Overhaul Required

- **Fundamental problem**: Essay explains who Alex is and how they became who they are, but “does very little to explain why those programs” are the right fit
    
    - Current structure: extensive personal narrative with program connection only in final paragraph
    - Advisor has “privilege of having much deeper understanding” of Alex’s trajectory after reading draft, but application readers won’t
    - “Unfortunately, I think that’s going to need to be condensed for the sake of making sure that you can spend a greater amount”
    - **Minimum requirement**: “At least 50% of this essay needs to be you crafting arguments for why Luce is the best fit for you”
    - “Also why you’re a good fit for Luce, but that will come naturally if you can convince someone that Luce is the right match for you”
        
- **Current program connection insufficient**:
    
    - Only mentions lack of “formal development program to magnify your abilities” at very end
    - Wants to expand initiatives “beyond the US and Mexico and into Chinese markets” or “more global, specifically Asian markets”
    - Mentions specific placements in separate part of application, but personal statement has “so much more space”
    - “You really do yourself a disservice by connecting it back to Luce only in that last paragraph”
        
- **Specific content to expand**:
    
    - Luce Impact essay “does this very well” with placement specifics, but personal statement allows deeper dive
    - Mentioned interest in working with organizations including “Ahsoka” (advisor noted Star Wars reference)
    - “Go into these different placements a little bit more and talk about why it would be important for you to be able to work with them, to be able to learn from them”
    - Buddhist engagement opportunity: Alex wants to “engage with Buddhism in a primarily Buddhist country or in a country that has a strong Buddhist tradition”
    - Can bring up Buddhist connections to specific organizations or geographical placements
        
- **Revision strategy options**:
    
    - Either “more quickly get to the part where you’re pulling your threads together”
    - OR “find a way to incorporate those threads more throughout your personal narrative”
    - “The percentage of your words spent on either subject is going to change drastically”
    - Keep “very engaging” opening paragraph about valuing international perspective and Buddhism introduction
    - “Use that as a way you can pull that thread through a little bit more intentionally so it doesn’t feel as if you’re going into this beautifully written personal narrative and then jumping back out with four sentences about why Luce is a good idea”
        
- **Writing process reality check**:
    
    - “So common that your first draft ends up looking very different from your first draft, and it doesn’t mean that your first draft wasn’t essential for you to write in order to get there”
    - “Aspects of this first draft that unfortunately are going to have to be condensed or cut”
    - Advisor background: “Applied and been successful for these types of grants myself, helps other students do it, but also was a creative writing major in a former life”
    - Alex acknowledged: “This is my first draft” and “just want to get stuff out there” - similar realization about missing Luce connection thread

### Grant Application Philosophy - Personal Statement Structure

- **Core principle**: Programs “not trying to trick you” with prompts, but implicit expectations exist
    - Luce prompt: “Use this space, maximum 1,000 words, share your personal and professional journey, your long-term personal and professional goals, how you have grown and evolved over time, and how this journey has shaped your vision and aspirations for making an impact in the world”
    - Alex took this “too literally” - prompt is genuine but incomplete picture of what’s needed
    - “What they mean is yes, they want to know your personal journey… but they want to know it specifically: How did your personal journey lead you to the point that you’re applying for this?”
        
- **Writing Studio framework reference**:
    
    - Beth’s explanation from Alex’s Fulbright year (though “many years ago”)
    - “Personal statement on a grant application is, yes, it’s personal, but it starts with some defining moment where you can trace back to when you started on the trajectory that made you want to do the thing you’re applying to do”
    - Structure: “When was your origin point? And when are you getting to the climax of and now I’m applying for this?”
    - “It can be very personal. It can be very narrative. But it should be a personal narrative that is directing to the climax of, and now I’m applying for Luce, and here’s why Luce is the right for me”
        
- **Alex’s current opening strategy validation**:
    
    - Can still open with “pivotal moment” - traditional and effective approach
    - But need to “get into the tying the threads together much faster”
    - Use examples while tying threads rather than “putting the examples and then tying the threads”
    - Current approach: “listing it more narrative style” needs to shift to “This is exactly why it’s connected to Luce”

### Schwarzman Application - Parallel Issues with Additional Complexity

- **Same structural problem as Luce**:
    
    - Statement of Purpose incomplete but “seems like you were going down kind of the same line”
    - “Just not strong enough for this award”
    - Need to focus on “making the argument for Luce and then again for Schwarzman specifically”
        
- **Buddhist integration strategic considerations**:
    
    - Alex practices Tibetan Buddhism, has “taken refuge formally”
    - Tibet “technically a part of China” - creates complex political dynamics
    - “Extremely political hot button issue” especially if insinuating Tibet isn’t part of China
    - Learning Tibetan language next month - shows serious commitment
    - Advisor initially cautioned: “China has about the same amount of Buddhist presence as The United States”
        
- **Deeper Buddhist context discussion**:
    
    - Alex’s counterpoint: China retains “Confucianism, Taoism, legalism, Buddhism as kind of like those are still, like, even if people are not formally practicing”
    - Comparison to America being “Judeo Christian” with declining adherence but cultural underpinning
    - Chinese students at Vanderbilt confirmed: “It is so ingrained within the culture” even for non-practitioners
    - Students would mention practicing relatives, similar to American grandmother Christianity references
    - Buddhism “very much underpins a lot of the culture” alongside Confucianism and Taoism
        
- **Revised advisor perspective after discussion**:
    
    - Initially harsh critique, but “I do walk back my critique a little bit”
    - “I think you have a shot… you do actually… I could see a world where you use that as a direct reason or direct way of potentially engaging during your Schwarzman”
    - Schwarzman emphasizes “a lot of travel within China and all these different field trips”
    - Alex could engage “not only from a personal standpoint, religious standpoint, but from a developmental standpoint of seeing the region currently”
        
- **Strategic framing considerations**:
    
    - Schwarzman “is not funded by the Chinese government” - provides more leeway than government-funded programs
    - Advisor will consult Dr. Lambert about “terminology around Tibetan Buddhism” and how to approach with different ideological perspectives
    - Tibet and Beijing are “very different” locations with different Buddhist engagement possibilities
    - Cultural engagement through Buddhism “not as directly viable as a pull to Schwarzman as it is for Luce”

### Team Dynamics Essay - Complete Narrative Reconstruction Needed

- **Current structural problems**:
    
    - “I think you chose a good example” but “getting lost in your prose”
    - “Can’t clearly understand what challenge was presented and how you demonstrated teamwork”
    - Prose indicates “it was a big deal” but reader doesn’t “actually know what the challenge was”
    - General understanding: “getting some very intense feedback, and so you went and met with different members of your team”
    - Result: “What I actually gained from this as far as your teamwork skills… is so general”

- **Critical missing context being underutilized**:
    
    - Alex is “not a Mexican national working for a Mexican company in Mexico”
    - Operating in “culturally very different” environment than trained in
    - “Doing it in your second language. Or even possibly a third language”
    - “Navigating interpersonal dynamics” while “trying to be” culturally appropriate
    - “So much nuance to being a Fulbrighter and specifically to be doing the binational business program”
        
- **Advisor’s personal validation**:
    
    - “I’ve also been chewed out by my boss as a Fulbrighter”
    - “It’s an emotional experience”
    - “You do not outgrow getting negative feedback from your boss”
    - “You’re going to have to do that in a foreign country again” during Luce

- **Unique value proposition being lost**:
    
    - “All of that is lost by you trying to downplay your emotion”
    - “You are completely losing this edge that you bring”
    - Perspective that “not many applicants are” going to have
    - “Someone who not only is doing a Fulbright, did a very unique and very intense Fulbright”
        
- **Specific revision guidance**:
    
    - “Give yourself - I mean this so respectfully - stop writing it as if it’s like a teen coming of age movie”
    - “Those emotions are very relatable, are not the most impressive part of the story”
    - “Strip the prose down a little bit, tone back the self-fixated emotion a little bit”
    - “Allow yourself to kind of hype yourself up on how you were able to navigate this dynamic and how you learned from it in a way that was respectful and allowed you to be a stronger contributor in the future”
    - “You don’t have to paint yourself to be a hero… I’d actually recommend that you don’t go that far”
    - “Paint yourself as someone who was learning very valuable skills during this process”
        
- **Alex’s writing pattern recognition**:
    
    - “I tend to be very particular about how I phrase things, and I definitely sometimes sacrifice functionality”
    - “Losing out on the function of… what was actually going on”
    - “Become too abstracted and generalist rather than as a way to complement and create a story”
    - 250-word limit creates pressure to “mention bounce here, here, here, then it becomes way more nebulous”
        
- **Story confirmation and focus**:
    
    - Advisor: “I think that’s the best story to have”
    - “The problem is I don’t feel like I know the story”
    - Story remains relevant: “You’re gonna be in a foreign country again, you’re probably going to also be getting negative feedback”
    - Shift from “Alex coming and being like, oh my gosh? This is so crazy” to demonstrating valuable skill development

### Leadership Essay - Theory vs. Concrete Narrative Balance

- **Current overemphasis on theory**:
    
    - “Heavy in theory. And heavy in what kind of leader you want to be and what inspires that”
    - “Very theoretical, and it’s very… what perspectives you value in the leadership”
    - “You spend a lot of time using less concrete words”
    - Focus on “what you value in leadership and where those values come from and what they’re rooted in”
        
- **Missing narrative opportunity**:
    
    - “Luce is giving you an opportunity to tell another story, and you’re not taking it”
    - “Think about revisiting this condensing the introduction… and then spend the rest of the essay telling a quick narrative”
    - Can discuss “a time that you’ve either seen leadership or you can also talk about” others’ leadership
    - “It doesn’t have to be you” demonstrating leadership
    - Goal: “Show yourself a little bit more even if you’re showing yourself by talking about someone else”
        
- **Luce program context for revision**:
    
    - “Luce is a practical fellowship. It is a practical fellowship”
    - “You’re not going to study similar to your binational business program”
    - “They will appreciate that you’re grounded in theory because it means that you’re well educated, well read, and you’ve been exposed to a lot of different perspectives”
    - “But you’re not applying for a graduate program and you’re not applying for a scholarship to fund theoretical research”
    - “You’re applying for an opportunity to go do hands-on work in another context”
    - “You’re applying to go be a practitioner”
        
- **Strategic balance for revision**:
    
    - “They’re going to appreciate that you’re grounded in values and theory. You shouldn’t hide that by any means”
    - But demonstrate practical application and concrete examples
    - “Keep that in mind with writing your essays”
        

### Schwarzman Short Answer Strategy and Timing

- **Critical timing principle**:
    
    - “This should be the last part of the application you write”
    - “Once you’ve written the entire application and you read back through it and you think, shoot. There’s this aspect of myself that I think is so important for the Schwarzman Review Board to know, and there was no way for me to fit it in anywhere”
    - “That’s what those 100 words are for”
        
- **Current draft problems**:
    
    - “Very theory and values based… because it’s not the last thing you wrote”
    - Current content about Freemasonry: “Very interesting fun fact. I’m not denying that”
    - “Free Mason degree is not something that everyone is necessarily involved with… that is something that is very unique to you”
    - But need to consider if it’s the most strategic use of limited space
        
- **Suitcase packing analogy**:
    
    - “It’s supposed to be a catch-all”
    - “When you unzip your suitcase because you have the two inches and you told yourself you weren’t gonna pack more, but you have to”
    - “You don’t have room for anything else but you absolutely have to bring a hair dryer on this trip. You’re putting the hair dryer in these last 100 words”
        
- **Strategic approach for Alex**:
    
    - Wait until main essays completed to identify gaps
    - Find “something that truly no one else applying for this is going to have”
    - Ideally connect back to “why Schwarzman” in some capacity
    - “Don’t overthink it” but be strategic about unique differentiator
        

### Buddhist Integration Strategy Across Applications

- **Stronger fit for Luce than Schwarzman**:
    
    - Luce offers “possibilities of being placed in placements that have a much stronger Buddhist presence”
    - “All the threads should be woven together throughout the application”
    - “Threads of you wanting to continue to grow in Buddhist values makes a lot more sense for Luce”
    - For Schwarzman: “Less ways that it makes sense for you to be intentional about this”
        
- **Schwarzman complications initially identified**:
    
    - “China has about the same amount of Buddhist presence as The United States”
    - “You likely will not be able to engage with Buddhism in any way where it is more… it’s just not… you won’t be able to have the same argument of cultural engagement through Buddhism that you could [elsewhere]”
    - “Cultural engagement isn’t like a pillar necessarily [for Fulbright], but it is always an underlying aspect to have in the back of your mind for international exchanges”
        
- **Revised perspective after Alex’s input**:
    
    - Alex’s Tibetan Buddhism practice adds political complexity but also unique angle
    - China’s cultural Buddhist underpinning alongside Confucianism/Taoism
    - Schwarzman travel throughout China could provide engagement opportunities
    - Advisor acknowledges: “I could be again, very wrong. My expertise is not in Beijing”
    - “Tibet and Buddhism being a pull… Tibetan Buddhism being a pull specifically to Beijing is not… unless there’s something I’m misunderstanding”
        
- **Implementation guidance**:
    
    - Advisor will consult Dr. Lambert on terminology and framing
    - Consider how different ideological perspectives might receive the content
    - Balance personal authenticity with strategic presentation
    - Stronger emphasis for Luce applications, more cautious integration for Schwarzman
### Technical and Administrative Details

- **Alex’s current work situation affecting timeline**:
    
    - “Working on a technology startup idea with a friend” taking time
    - “Strange schedule” but “still really do wanna apply for this”
    - Got meeting scheduled to “course correct and not go further down” wrong path
        
- **Advisor credentials and approach**:
    
    - “Applied and been successful for these types of grants myself”
    - “Helps other students do it”
    - “Creative writing major in a former life”
    - Experience with Writing Studio at Vanderbilt
    - Taiwan Fulbright experience provides relevant cultural context
        
- **Meeting logistics and follow-up**:
    
    - No meeting immediately after for either party
    - Will send Word document with all feedback points this afternoon
    - Will consult Dr. Lambert about Tibetan Buddhism terminology before sending notes
    - September availability extremely limited due to Fulbright interviews
    - If no final meeting slots available, can provide asynchronous review
    - “At the very least, one of us can likely review async if not… schedule”

### Alex’s Self-Assessment and Recognition

- **Writing pattern acknowledgment**:
    
    - “I tend to be very theoretically minded person, and sometimes it can be harder to concretize”
    - “That’s still my natural inclination” even when concrete examples exist
    - “Broader weakness that I have outside of even just this essay”
    - “I can sometimes get a bit lost in the abstraction to the point where it’s like, okay. What is what is even going on here?”
        
- **Application prompt interpretation learning**:
    
    - Initially read Luce prompt “too literally”
    - Recognition that “implicit narrative is equally as important”
    - Understanding that prompts may not explicitly state expectations but “this is basically shouting why Luce”
    - Similar pattern recognition for Schwarzman applications
        
- **Process and timeline realization**:
    
    - “First thing after writing it… was like, okay. I just wanna get stuff out there”
    - “Realized I was getting down to the word limit, I had the same thought of, like, oh, this is… missing that thread that connects to Luce itself”
    - Plan to “condense a lot and go back and perhaps kind of rewrite, maybe Frankenstein a little bit”
    - Ready to incorporate “100%” of advisor feedback “without exception”
        
- **Appreciation for advisor process**:
    
    - “I used to work the writing studio at Vanderbilt. So I know the extent that you have to read to do something like that”
    - Recognition of time and effort required for thorough feedback
    - “Everything you say has been extremely pertinent”
    - “Very grateful for the work that you all do and for the continued support through this process”

# Medium Summary Notes

Fri, 22 Aug 25

### Luce Personal Statement - Complete Restructuring Required

- **Fundamental structural problem**: Personal narrative dominates, program connection minimal
    
    - Currently only connects to Luce in final paragraph about lacking formal training - “major disservice”
    - Need minimum 50% focused on why Luce specifically is right fit for Alex
    - Personal story well-written but needs condensing to make room for program arguments
        
- **Specific content to expand**:
    
    - Formal development program need to “magnify abilities” beyond US-Mexico into Chinese/Asian markets
    - Specific placements Alex mentioned (including Ahsoka reference)
    - Why working with particular organizations would be valuable learning experience
    - Buddhist engagement opportunities in Buddhist-majority countries
        
- **Structural approach for revision**:
    
    - Keep engaging opening paragraph (Buddhism introduction through international perspective)
    - Use opening as thread to weave throughout rather than jumping back to program connection
    - Either get to thread-pulling faster OR incorporate threads throughout personal narrative
    - Percentage of words on personal vs. program connection must “change drastically”
        
- **Writing process reality**: First draft essential for getting thoughts out, but final version will look “very different” - normal for competitive grant applications
    

### Schwarzman Application - Similar Issues Plus Additional Considerations

- **Core problem mirrors Luce**: Going down “same rabbit hole” of personal narrative without program connection
    
    - Statement of Purpose incomplete but heading toward same weakness
    - “Just not strong enough for this award” in current form
        
- **Buddhist integration complexity**:
    
    - Tibetan Buddhism creates interesting political dynamics with China application
    - Alex practices Tibetan Buddhism, has taken formal refuge, learning Tibetan language next month
    - Tibet’s relationship with China makes this “extremely political hot button issue”
    - Less direct cultural engagement opportunity in Beijing vs. Buddhist-majority Luce placements
    - However: China still has Buddhist cultural underpinnings alongside Confucianism/Taoism
    - Chinese students at Vanderbilt confirmed Buddhism “ingrained within culture” despite declining formal practice
        
- **Strategic considerations**:
    
    - Schwarzman funded by Schwarzman Foundation (not Chinese government) - provides more leeway
    - Program emphasizes travel throughout China - potential engagement opportunity
    - Advisor will consult Dr. Lambert on best terminology and framing approach
        

### Team Dynamics Essay - Major Rewrite Needed

- **Current problems with chosen example**:
    
    - Good example selected but “lost in prose”
    - Challenge unclear - reader can’t understand what actually happened
    - Only general takeaway: “got harsh feedback, met with team members”
    - Missing specifics of Alex’s unique approach vs. how anyone else might handle
        
- **Critical missing context being underutilized**:
    
    - Alex is non-Mexican national working for Mexican company in Mexico
    - Navigating conflict in second (possibly third) language
    - Cultural dynamics of interpersonal workplace navigation as Fulbrighter
    - “So much nuance to being a Fulbrighter” - unique perspective most applicants lack
        
- **Specific revision guidance**:
    
    - Stop writing like “teen coming of age movie” focused on emotions
    - “Strip pros down, tone back self-fixated emotion”
    - Emphasize valuable skills learned navigating cultural/social/professional dynamics
    - Don’t paint as hero, but as someone learning valuable skills during process
    - This exact skill set needed for Luce placement in foreign country
        
- **Writing style adjustment**: Functionality must show through over artistic prose for this question
    

### Leadership Essay - Theory vs. Narrative Balance

- **Current weakness**: “Heavy in theory, heavy in what kind of leader you want to be”
    
    - Too focused on leadership values and theoretical perspectives
    - Missing opportunity to tell concrete story demonstrating leadership
    - Very theoretical without practical examples
        
- **Revision approach**:
    
    - Condense theoretical introduction about leadership values and where they’re rooted
    - Spend majority of essay on specific narrative example
    - Can discuss others’ leadership that inspired Alex, doesn’t have to be Alex’s own leadership
    - Show leadership principles through concrete embodiment rather than abstract discussion
        
- **Key insight**: Luce is practical fellowship, not graduate program
    
    - They appreciate theoretical grounding (shows education/exposure to perspectives)
    - But applying to be practitioner doing hands-on work, not theoretical researcher
    - Balance theory as foundation with practical application demonstration
### Schwarzman Short Answer Strategy

- **Write these essays last**: Should be final part of application process
    
    - After completing all main essays, identify what essential information is missing
    - Use as “catch-all” for aspects of yourself that must be included but didn’t fit elsewhere
    - Currently too theoretical/values-based because written too early in process
        
- **“Suitcase analogy”**: Like when you’ve packed everything and have 2 inches left
    
    - “You don’t have room for anything else but you absolutely have to bring a hair dryer”
    - These 100 words are for that essential item that won’t fit anywhere else
        
- **Current draft problems**:
    
    - Freemason involvement interesting but not necessarily unique differentiator
    - Need something truly distinctive that no other applicant will have
    - Must connect back to why Schwarzman in some capacity

### Grant Application Philosophy and Process

- **Personal statement structure for competitive grants**:
    
    - Start with defining moment/origin point of trajectory toward this application
    - Trace personal journey that led to point of applying for this specific opportunity
    - Climax should be “now I’m applying for program and here’s why it’s right match”
    - Can be very personal and narrative, but must direct toward program application
        
- **Writing process expectations**:
    
    - First drafts often look dramatically different from final versions
    - Common for creative writing backgrounds to over-prose initially
    - Essential to write personal narrative first, then condense/restructure for program focus
        
- **Target audience considerations**:
    
    - Reviewers want practical applicants who can execute, not just theorize
    - Show theoretical grounding but emphasize hands-on capability
    - Programs not trying to trick applicants, but implicit expectations beyond stated prompts

### Next Steps and Follow-up

- **Alex’s immediate priorities**:
    
    - Complete major rewrites of both personal statements with 50% minimum program focus
    - Rewrite team dynamics essay with specific details and cultural navigation emphasis
    - Finish all Schwarzman main essays before attempting short answers
    - Potentially “Frankenstein” existing content rather than complete restart
        
- **Advisor actions**:
    
    - Consult Dr. Lambert this afternoon on Tibetan Buddhism terminology for Schwarzman
    - Send Word document with all feedback points later today
    - Include Dr. Lambert’s guidance in documentation if received in time
        
- **Future meeting availability**:
    
    - Limited September availability due to Fulbright interviews
    - If no slots available, can request asynchronous review of drafts
    - At minimum, one advisor can likely provide written feedback on applications

# Short Summary Notes
### Luce Personal Statement - Major Revisions Needed

- **Current problem**: Too much personal narrative, not enough connection to Luce program
    
    - Only connecting back to Luce in final paragraph - major disservice
    - Need at least 50% focused on crafting arguments for why Luce is best fit for Alex
    - Missing formal training argument buried at end needs expansion
        
- **Restructuring approach**:
    
    - Condense personal story significantly
    - Pull threads through more intentionally from opening paragraph
    - Expand on specific placements and organizations Alex wants to work with
    - Connect Buddhist interests to placement opportunities more clearly
        
- **Writing process insight**: First draft essentially storytelling exercise - final draft will look dramatically different
    

### Schwarzman Application Strategy

- **Same core issue**: Personal narrative without sufficient program connection
    
    - Need stronger arguments for why Schwarzman specifically
    - Currently too theoretical, not practical enough
        
- **Buddhist thread considerations**:
    
    - Tibetan Buddhism connection to China creates interesting dynamic
    - Less direct cultural engagement opportunity in Beijing vs other locations
    - Schwarzman funded by Schwarzman Foundation, not Chinese government - provides leeway
    - Advisor will consult Dr. Lambert on best approach for Tibetan Buddhism framing

### Short Answer Essays - Specific Fixes Required

- **Luce Team Dynamics (Question 2)**:
    
    - Good example chosen but lost in prose
    - Challenge unclear - what specific problem occurred?
    - Missing key context: navigating workplace conflict as non-Mexican national in Mexico, in second language
    - Unique Fulbright experience angle underutilized
    - **Fix needed**: Strip down prose, focus on specific actions taken, emphasize cultural/professional navigation skills
    - Stop writing like “teen coming of age movie” - focus on valuable skills learned
        
- **Luce Leadership Essay**:
    
    - Too heavy on theory, missing narrative opportunity
    - Condense theoretical introduction, spend majority on specific example
    - Show leadership through concrete story rather than abstract values
    - Remember: Luce is practical fellowship, not graduate program
        
- **Schwarzman Short Answers**:
    
    - Write these last - use as “catch-all” for essential information that doesn’t fit elsewhere
    - Current answers too theoretical/values-based
    - Need unique differentiators that tie back to program goals

### Application Writing Philosophy

- **Grant applications require different approach than creative writing**:
    
    - Personal statement needs origin point → trajectory → climax of “now applying for this program”
    - Every thread must weave together throughout application
    - Functionality must show through over artistic prose
        
- **Target audience**: Reviewers want to see practical applicant who can execute, not just theorize
- **Buddhist integration**: Stronger pull for Luce (Buddhist-majority placement countries) than Schwarzman (Beijing focus)
    

### Next Steps

- **Alex**: Major rewrites of both personal statements with 50% program-specific focus
- **Alex**: Rewrite team dynamics essay with specific details and cultural navigation angle
- **Alex**: Complete all main essays before writing Schwarzman short answers
- **Advisor**: Consult Dr. Lambert on Tibetan Buddhism framing for Schwarzman application
- **Follow-up**: Alex to schedule final review session if availability allows in September

# Raw Notes

Fri, 22 Aug 25

- explain why those programs
    
- why alex needs to be doing the luce program
    
- end of personal statement, luce, not having formal training,
    
- personal story, spend a lot more time, bulk of the statement talking about why luce specifically, mention placements is good
    
- luce impact essay, but so much more space in personal statement
    
    - don’t have time to dive into your interest
        
    - go into these placements more, why it would be important to be able to work with them,
        
    - do a disservice, only connecting back to luce in that last paragraph
        
    - privilege of reading the draft,
        
    - clear understanding of that personal academic journey, need to be condensed, so you can spend a greater amount, at least 50% needs to be you crafting arguments for why luce is the best fit, and why you’re the best for luce
        
- similar to schwarzman
    
- applied and been successful, also creative writing major, final draft looks different than first draft, aspects that will have to be condensed or cut
    
    - tell story a lot shorter, more quickly get to teh part where you are pulling your threads together, incorporate throughout personal narrative
        
    - percentage of words spent on either subject, will have to change drastically
        
    - expand on teh different organizations
        
    - wanting to engage with buddhism in a primarly, cultural majority buddhist country; if there is any aspect that is related to the organizations you want to work with
        
        - nepal, buddhist organization
            
    - very engaging, introduction to how you started valuing international perspective
        
    - use introduction as a way to pull that thread through more intentionally, beautifully written personal narrative
        
- exact advice for statement of purpose for schwarzman
    
    - going down the same rabbit hole
        
    - just not strong enough for this award
        
    - making the argument
        
- not trying to trick you, even if they do not say it directly, yes they want to know your personal journey
    
- how has your personal journey led you to the point that you are applying to this
    
- writing studio workshop, great explanation saying that the personal statement on a grant application, yes it’s personal, but it starts with some defining moment, when you can trace back, when it made you want to do that thing that you wanted to do
    
- when was your origin point, and when are you getting to the climax, it can be very personal, directing to climax of now i am appling
    
- once you start working on it with that in mind, didn’t give yourself enough a time
    
- go back to luce
    
    - second short answer question, team dynamics, to a lesser extent, looking at it from this perspective
        
    - chose a good example, getting lost in the prose, what challenge was presented, and how you demonstrated teamwork
        
    - deep into the prose, trying to understand what the challenge actually was
        
    - don’t know what the challenge was, understand generally, intense feedback, met with members for teh team,
        
    - gain from teamwork skills, how you work on a team, so general, don’t give yourself room for specifics
        
    - too caught up in prose
        
    - unique style of writing, times that functionality will have to show through
        
    - know more than just in general, got harsh feedback so you met with your team members, i don’t know how you approached that, more specific, more of what is the way that alex approached this, versus how anyone
        
    - something to point out, briefly mention, did not dive into at all, not a mexican national, working for a mexican national, in mexico, culturally very different, trained in, navigating the horror of public intense negative feedback from your
        
    - doing it not in your first language, navigating interpersonal dynamics, and you’re trying to, so much nuance to being a fulbrighter, lost by trying to uplay your motion
        
    - losing this edge that you bring that tells a lot about your leadership style, trying to navigate cultural, personal, social dynamics, you will have to do this during the luce, do not outgrow negative feedback, do it in a foreign country again
        
    - unique and intense fulbright, not many applicants are, give yourself
        
    - strop writing it as if it is a teen coming of age movie, those emotions are not the most impressive part, strip the prose down, tone back the self-fixated emotion, hype yourself up, how you navigated this dynamic, how you learned from it
        
    - don’t paint yourself as a hero, but someone who was learning very valuable skills during this process, the prose is memorable but not effective,
        
- leadership short answer
    
    - heavy in theory, heavy in what kind of leader you want to be,
        
    - too much on theory
        
    - luce is giving you an opportunity to tell another story, and you’re not taking it
        
    - still grounded in theory and values, very theoretical, perspectives you value within leadership
        
    - tell another story
        
    - think about revisiting this, condensing the introduction, of what you value in leadership, where it comes from, what it is rooted in, THEN tell a quick narrative, a time you have seen
        
    - team dynamics, how you work, leadership essay about what you value, more concrete about how you have seen these things embodied, relevant to what you are applying for
        
    - not bad example, robbing yourself of a chance to show yourself a little bit more, even if you show
        
    - luce is a practical fellowship, you are not going to study, they will appreciate that you are grounded in theory because you are well educated, well read, exposed to different perspectives, not applying ot graduate program or scholarship, applying to do hands on work in another context
        
    - do not hide values and theory but you are applying to be a practitioner
        
- schwarzman
    
    - same critique for luce, why schwarzman
        
    - next strongest critique is your short answer questions,
        
        - for schwarzman, it is a sense of think about what you are applying for, and make sure you are connecting it back
            
        - those are not values in
            
        - not something everyone is involved with
            
        - think about how you could use this space, these 100 words, to talk about something that truly no one else applying for this is going to have that is either, do not overthink it
            
        - last part of the application that you write, once you have written the entire application, shoot there is this aspect of myself, and there was no way to fit it in anywhere
            
        - truly supposed to be a catchall, when you unzip your suitcase, and you had those extra 2 inches, it is supposed to be that you do not have any room
            
    - specific note
        
        - in your bio, you say that
            
    - overarching advice
        
        - keep in mind for schwarzman
            
        - values as someone who practices buddhism, especially in luce application, keep in mind that when you are applying for luce
            
        - all threads should be woven together throughout the application
            
        - threads of wanting to continue to grow in buddhist values, makes a lot more sense for luce, possibilities for being placed in locations with buddhist presence, within
            
        - those are not going to be as easy to tie in for the sake of it, as it can be for the luce
            
        - less ways to be intentional about this in schwarzman
            
        - red flag → it will not be as relevant to your project
            
    - tibet??
        
        - engage with it differently, likely not able to engage with buddhism where it is more
            
        - in beijing versus, not have the same argument of cultural engagement through buddhism, it is always an underlying aspect to have in the back of your mind
            
        - not directly viable as a pull for schwarzman as it is to luce
            
        - tibetan buddhism, being a pull to beijing is not, unless i
