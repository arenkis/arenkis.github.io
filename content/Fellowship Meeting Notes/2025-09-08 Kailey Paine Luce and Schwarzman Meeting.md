# Overall: making application(s) submittable

## Schwarzman 

- [[Schwarzman Disciplinary Action]] and [[Schwarzman Clarification Comment]] check (2 mins)
	- Is it okay to write for both? One to discuss solely the withdrawal component and the other to describe more of the comeback.
	- Removed specificity, discussing solely medical leave and positive outcomes
- [[Schwarzman Leadership CV]] check (5 mins)
	- Does this look good in general? 
	- No need to get into the weeds, just checking it is coherent
	- My friend suggested a Leadership Takeaways component to each item which I loved
- [[Schwarzman Short Answer Questions]] 1 review (5 mins)
	- Cut the founder-funder-facilitator arc based on feedback from another applicant
	- I started with Draft 2 but then realized it would fit better in the statement of purpose
	- Need advice for what to write here
- [[Schwarzman Short Answer Questions]] 2 review (5 mins)
	- Maybe I am taking this too literally, but I am going literally based on "would not otherwise [be] know[n] based on the other parts of this application."
	- Upon further reflection, I decided to rewrite the question to talk about Freemasonry, since it fits a strict interpretation of the definition, represents something I could explore in China, and connects to my leadership philosophy
- [[Schwarzman Video]] check (2 mins)
	- I may have already filmed this when we discuss it
	- Planning to film it in a cemetery
	- Again, went for the central thread since it is meant to be an introduction rather than like in the Luce which is something specific you have not shared
- [[Schwarzman Leadership Essay]] review (10 mins)
	- Mostly revised the first and last paragraphs after receiving feedback from another applicant
	- Slightly more explicit about leadership approach, adding a few sentences here or there referencing the specific traits I lived out
- [[Schwarzman Bio]] check (1 min)
	- Minor language tweaks
	- Added academic details (PBK, dual degree)
- [[Schwarzman Awards and Recognitions]] check (2 mins)
	- My friend suggested cutting departmental honors (because every candidate has this), though I felt like it would be advisable to leave it in because of the original research component / trying to get published / presenting findings in a way that had an impact
- [[Schwarzman Statement of Purpose]] review (10 mins)
	- Adjusted from founder-funder-facilitator closing to talk about "why schwarzman", mentioning specific activities / projects to do once there

## Luce

- [[Luce Video]] review (2 mins)
	- I would really appreciate feedback as to what to do for this video
	- Asks for something "that isnâ€™t reflected elsewhere in your application"
	- Could go cemetery route, temple route, masonry route; I am thinking of places that would be unique on camera
- [[Luce Short Answer Questions Responses]] 1 review (5 mins)
	- Adjusted leadership theory to include a story
	- Mapped Thich Nhat Hanh to Buddhist-inspired startup, focus on initiative, community building, and communication that empowers others
	- Need to ensure this does not come off as choppy or forced, or pivot otherwise
- [[Luce Short Answer Questions Responses]] 2 review (5 mins)
	- Incorporated feedback to make the story more specific
	- Removed "coming of age" feelings in place of navigating cultural dynamics (hierarchies, specific cues, pressures, failures, success, etc.)
- [[Luce Short Answer Questions Responses]] 3 review (5 mins)
	- Since I reworked my personal statement (see below), I already discuss many elements of the Luce impact (placements, cultural immersion, etc.)
	- I am wondering what to put for this question now
- [[Luce Personal Statement]] review (10 mins)
	- General rewrite
	- Added paragraph showing my unique connection to Luce (exploring death / ancestor worship in Asia, which is the most notable region for these practices)
	- Added paragraph on placements (discussing 2 existing, 3 potential placements with reason)
	- Honed last paragraph to focus on specifics, next steps
